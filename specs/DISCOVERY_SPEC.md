# Discovery Phase Specification

## Overview

The Discovery phase is where participants review traces and provide structured feedback that the system synthesizes into evaluation criteria and surfaces disagreements. It replaces the previous discovery flow with a more structured, AI-assisted approach.

Discovery has three steps, each corresponding to a GitHub sub-issue of [#80](https://github.com/databricks-solutions/project-0xfffff/issues/80):

| Step | Issue | Summary |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Step 1: Feedback Collection** | [#81](https://github.com/databricks-solutions/project-0xfffff/issues/81) | Participants review traces, provide GOOD/BAD + comment, answer 3 AI follow-up questions |
| **Step 2: Findings Synthesis** | [#82](https://github.com/databricks-solutions/project-0xfffff/issues/82) | Facilitator triggers AI analysis: aggregate feedback, detect disagreements, distill evaluation criteria |
| **Step 3: Structured Feedback & Promotion** | [#13](https://github.com/databricks-solutions/project-0xfffff/issues/13) | Facilitator reviews synthesized findings and promotes key criteria to draft rubric |

> **Future work — Iterative rounds**: Steps 1-2-3 may be run more than once per workshop. In subsequent rounds, observations from prior rounds would be integrated into the follow-up question and distillation prompts. For MVP, Discovery runs as a single pass.

## Core Concepts

### Feedback
Each participant provides one feedback record per trace:
- **Label**: GOOD or BAD (required)
- **Comment**: Free-text explanation (required)
- **Follow-up Q&A**: 3 AI-generated follow-up questions with participant answers

### Follow-Up Questions
- **Count**: Exactly 3 per trace (fixed)
- **Generation**: AI-generated based on participant's feedback label, comment, and prior Q&A
- **Style**: Sharp, specific questions probing *why* the participant rated the way they did (system prompt is configurable — see [System Prompts](#system-prompts))
- **Progressive**: Each question builds on previous answers (full conversation context)
- **Required**: All 3 must be answered before moving to next trace

### Disagreement Detection
After feedback is collected, the system detects three types of disagreements across participants:

| Priority | Type | Meaning |
|----------|------|---------|
| HIGH | Rating disagreement | One participant rated GOOD, another rated BAD on the same trace |
| MEDIUM | Both BAD, different issues | Both rated BAD but identified different problems |
| LOWER | Both GOOD, different strengths | Both rated GOOD but valued different aspects |

Detection is **deterministic** (label comparison, no LLM). The LLM then *analyzes* detected disagreements to surface underlying themes and facilitator suggestions.

### Criteria Distillation
An LLM analyzes all feedback in a single batch to extract evaluation criteria — specific, actionable quality dimensions grounded in evidence from particular traces. These criteria become candidates for rubric questions.

### Draft Rubric Items
The facilitator can promote distilled criteria into draft rubric items, which bridge Discovery output into the Rubric Creation phase.

### Alternative Approaches (Assisted Facilitation — Roadmap)

> **Spec retirement note (2026-06)**: The standalone `ASSISTED_FACILITATION_SPEC` was retired and folded into this section. None of the behaviors below shipped to the UI — they are roadmap, not requirements, and carry no success criteria. The v1 backend endpoints still exist in `server/routers/discovery.py` but are dormant (no UI callers): `POST /findings-v2`, `GET /traces/{trace_id}/discovery-state`, `GET /discovery-progress`, `POST /findings/{finding_id}/promote`, `PUT /traces/{trace_id}/thresholds`, `GET /traces/{trace_id}/discovery-questions`, and the legacy `GET /draft-rubric` alias.

The `feat/discovery-update` branch implemented a more sophisticated real-time approach that may be revisited in future iterations:

- **Real-time finding classification**: Each participant submission is immediately classified by LLM into categories (themes, edge_cases, boundary_conditions, failure_modes, missing_info) via DSPy signatures. Gives the facilitator a live coverage view.
- **LLM-based disagreement detection**: DSPy compares findings across users per trace to detect semantic conflicts, rather than relying on label comparison.
- **Iterative summary pipeline**: Multi-step LLM pipeline that extracts themes, patterns, candidate rubric questions, discussion prompts, and convergence metrics.
- **Coverage thresholds**: Per-category, per-trace thresholds that the facilitator can adjust to signal when enough findings have been collected.
- **Fuzzy progress**: Participants see global progress without category breakdowns to avoid biasing their observations.
- **Ready-for-rubric signal**: Automated assessment of whether enough convergence exists to move to rubric creation.

Reference implementation: `server/services/discovery_service.py`, `server/services/classification_service.py`, `server/services/discovery_dspy.py`

## Step 1: Feedback Collection (Issue #81)

### Participant Flow

1. **View Trace** — Participant sees trace input/output via TraceViewer (reused component)
2. **Provide Feedback** — Select GOOD or BAD, write comment explaining reasoning
3. **Answer Follow-Up Questions** (progressive disclosure):
   - Q1 appears after feedback submission (1-3s loading spinner)
   - Participant answers Q1
   - Q2 appears (builds on Q1 context)
   - Participant answers Q2
   - Q3 appears (builds on Q1+Q2 context)
   - Participant answers Q3
4. **Next Trace** — Button appears after Q3, state resets for next trace
5. **Completion** — After all assigned traces, participant sees completion message

### Facilitator Flow (Starting Discovery)

1. Select traces for discovery using the existing trace assignment mechanism (see [Trace Assignment & Ordering](#trace-assignment--ordering))
2. Configure trace limit (default: 10, or custom)
3. Toggle randomization (randomize trace order per participant, off by default)
4. Click "Start Discovery Phase" — workshop phase changes to DISCOVERY
5. Monitor participant progress (completion dashboard)

### State Machine (Per Trace)

```
feedback → generating_q1 → answering_q1 →
           generating_q2 → answering_q2 →
           generating_q3 → answering_q3 → complete

Error/retry path (from any generating_q* state):
  generating_q* → error → (retry) → generating_q*
                        → (max retries) → fallback_question → answering_q*
```

- On LLM failure, show error toast with retry button
- After 3 failed retries, provide a generic fallback question so the participant isn't blocked
- Feedback and prior Q&A are saved incrementally — no data loss on failure

### UI Components

**DiscoveryFeedbackView** (main participant interface):
```
[TraceViewer — reuse existing component]

[Feedback Form] (state = 'feedback')
  Radio: Good / Bad
  Textarea: Comment (required)
  Button: "Submit Feedback" (disabled until both filled)

[Loading Spinner] (state = 'generating_q*')
  "Generating follow-up question..."

[Question + Answer Form] (state = 'answering_q*')
  [Previous Q&A pairs — read-only, stacked]
  [Current Question — highlighted]
  Textarea: Answer (required)
  Button: "Submit Answer" (disabled until filled)

[Completion] (state = 'complete')
  Success message
  Button: "Next Trace" / "Complete Discovery"
```

**DiscoveryStartPage** (facilitator):
- Trace count display
- Trace limit selector
- Randomization toggle
- "Start Discovery Phase" button

**DiscoveryPendingPage** (participant waiting state):
- Clock icon, explanation of what Discovery involves
- Auto-refreshes every 5 seconds to detect start

### Follow-Up Question Generation

Uses the `GenerateFollowUpQuestion` DSPy signature. The UX researcher persona instructions live in the **signature docstring** (see `server/services/discovery_dspy.py`).

**InputFields** (structured data passed to the signature):

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `trace_input` | The user's original input to the chatbot |
| `trace_output` | The chatbot's response |
| `feedback_label` | Reviewer's label (e.g. good, bad, neutral) |
| `feedback_comment` | Reviewer's written comment |
| `prior_qna` | Prior follow-up Q&A history, or `"(none yet)"` |

**OutputField**: `question` — the follow-up question for the reviewer.

> Note: Traces do not have a `use_case` field. The trace model has `input`, `output`, `context`, and `trace_metadata`. The workshop-level `description` provides use case context if needed.

**Error handling**: If LLM fails, show error toast with retry. After 3 retries, provide a fallback generic question.

## Step 2: Findings Synthesis (Issue #82)

### Facilitator Flow

1. **Trigger Analysis** — Click "Analyze Discovery Feedback" (available at any time, even with partial feedback)
2. **System processes**:
   a. Aggregate all feedback by trace
   b. Detect disagreements (3 priority tiers)
   c. Call LLM with distillation prompt to extract criteria and analyze disagreements
3. **View Results** — Structured analysis display in facilitator dashboard
4. **Re-run** — Can run analysis again at any time; each run creates a new record. Prior analyses are preserved for comparison.

### Aggregation

Group all feedback by `trace_id`:
```python
{
  trace_id: {
    "input": str,       # Trace input (raw, or JSONPath-extracted if configured)
    "output": str,      # Trace output (raw, or JSONPath-extracted if configured)
    "feedback_entries": [
      {"user": str, "label": str, "comment": str, "followup_qna": [...]}
    ]
  }
}
```

> If the workshop has `input_jsonpath`/`output_jsonpath` configured (see `TRACE_DISPLAY_SPEC`), use the extracted values for the LLM prompt — they'll be cleaner than raw JSON.

### Disagreement Detection (Deterministic — No LLM)

For each trace with multiple reviewers:
- If labels differ (GOOD vs BAD) → **HIGH priority**
- If all BAD → **MEDIUM priority** (different issues may exist)
- If all GOOD → **LOWER priority** (different strengths may be valued)

### Analysis Templates (LLM)

The facilitator selects an **analysis template** before triggering analysis. Each template uses a different distillation prompt but the same pipeline (aggregate → detect → call LLM → store).

**Preset templates:**

| Template | Focus | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Evaluation Criteria** (default) | Distill specific, actionable quality dimensions with evidence and priority | Criteria list + disagreement analysis |
| **Themes & Patterns** | Identify recurring themes, patterns, tendencies, risks, and strengths | Theme clusters + pattern analysis |

Both templates include disagreement analysis (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOWER). The difference is how the LLM frames the *positive* observations — as formal criteria vs. emergent themes.

> **Future**: Facilitators can add custom templates by providing their own prompt text. For MVP, the two presets are sufficient.

See [System Prompts](#system-prompts) section for full prompt text of each template.

### Analysis Results Display

Analysis results are **co-located with traces**, not shown in a separate tab. After analysis runs:

- **Trace-specific findings** (findings with `evidence_trace_ids` referencing a single trace, and disagreements with a `trace_id`) appear directly on that trace's card in the feed, pinned above the raw participant feedback.
- **Cross-trace findings** (findings referencing multiple traces or no specific trace) appear in a collapsible summary section above the trace feed.

This eliminates the need for a separate "Analysis" tab and keeps findings in context with the traces that produced them.

See [Facilitator Discovery Workspace](#facilitator-discovery-workspace) for the full UI layout.

## Step 3: Structured Feedback & Promotion (Issue #13)

### Problem

During Discovery, key insights surface through participant feedback and AI analysis but are not systematically captured or easily promoted into formal grading criteria. Critical declarations from SMEs can be missed, and there's no structured path from "observation" to "rubric question."

### Promotable Material

Everything from Discovery is promotable to the draft rubric. The facilitator can always edit text before or after promoting.

| Source | Example | How it promotes |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Analysis findings** (Step 2) | *"Provide specific, verifiable confirmation (transaction IDs)"* | Click "Promote" → pre-fills text + source traces |
| **Disagreement insights** (Step 2) | *"Rating split: one said phrasing fine, other wanted 2FA"* | Click "Promote" → pre-fills with underlying theme, facilitator edits |
| **Raw participant feedback** | A specific GOOD/BAD comment or follow-up answer | Click "Promote" → copies text, facilitator refines |
| **Manual entry** | Facilitator's own observation from discussion | Click "+ Add Item" → free-form text |

### Draft Rubric Sidebar

The draft rubric is a **persistent right sidebar** within the Facilitator Discovery Workspace (see [Facilitator Discovery Workspace](#facilitator-discovery-workspace)). It is always visible while the facilitator browses traces and analysis results, making the "promote" action tangible — items visibly move from the trace feed into the sidebar.

```
[Draft Rubric Sidebar]
  "5 items · 2 groups"

  -- Response Quality --
    · Accuracy matters           [trace ref]
    · Completeness gap           [trace ref]
    · Context needed             [trace ref]

  -- Tone & Style --
    · Brevity tolerance          [trace ref]
    · Formality level            [trace ref]

  [Suggest Groups]
  [+ Add manually]

  ---
  [Create Rubric →]
  Groups become criteria
```

**Display rules:**
- Item text is editable inline. Actions: Edit, Remove.
- **Trace reference badges are kept** on each item — they serve as example anchors when building rubric criteria in the next step. Badges are compact and interactive (hover for trace content preview, click to scroll to trace in feed).
- **Source-type badges are removed** (Finding, Disagreement, Feedback, Manual) — the facilitator does not need to know _where_ an item came from, only what it says.

### Grouping: Draft Items → Rubric Questions

Each group of related draft items becomes one rubric question. Grouping can be done manually or with LLM assistance.

**"Suggest Groups" action:**
1. Facilitator clicks "Suggest Groups" on the Draft Rubric panel
2. LLM analyzes all current draft items and returns a grouping *proposal* (not yet saved)
3. Each proposed cluster has a suggested rubric question title (e.g., "Response Accuracy", "Security Compliance")
4. Facilitator reviews the proposal — can adjust group assignments, rename groups, move items between groups
5. Facilitator clicks "Apply Groups" to persist the grouping to the DB
6. Until "Apply" is clicked, existing group assignments are unchanged

**Manual grouping:**
- Drag-and-drop items between groups
- Create new group, name it
- Move items freely
- Manual changes save immediately (no proposal flow needed)

**Group → Rubric question mapping:**
- Each group's items become the evidence/definition for a single rubric question
- The group name becomes the rubric question title
- The combined item texts inform the question description, positive/negative examples

### Handoff to Rubric Creation

The draft rubric feeds into the Rubric Creation phase (see `RUBRIC_SPEC`):

- **Phase gate**: Workshop can advance from Discovery → Rubric Creation when at least one `DraftRubricItem` exists OR discovery feedback exists
- **Draft items as starting points**: Grouped draft items appear as pre-populated rubric question suggestions. The facilitator can accept, edit, or discard each one.
- **AI Rubric Generation** (existing `rubric_generation_service.py`): Remains available as a complementary option. The facilitator can trigger AI rubric suggestions at any time — the service uses discovery feedback and analysis results as input. AI suggestions appear alongside draft items, not replacing them.
- **Traceability preserved**: Each rubric question can trace back to the discovery evidence that motivated it (via `source_trace_ids` on the draft items)

## Facilitator Discovery Workspace

The facilitator's discovery experience is a **single two-panel workspace** that replaces the previous multi-page flow (FacilitatorDashboard discovery mode + FindingsReviewPage + separate DiscoveryAnalysisTab). All three discovery steps (feedback monitoring, analysis, draft rubric) are accessible from one screen.

### Layout

```
+-----------------------------------------------------+----------------------+
|  MAIN CONTENT (scrollable, ~70%)                     |  DRAFT RUBRIC        |
|                                                      |  SIDEBAR (~30%)      |
|  [Overview Bar]                                      |  (persistent)        |
|  [Cross-Trace Analysis Summary] (collapsible)        |                      |
|  [Trace Feed — cards with feedback + findings]       |                      |
|                                                      |                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------+----------------------+
```

### Overview Bar

Compact bar at the top of the main content area. Replaces the previous "quick actions" card.

```
Discovery  ·  4 participants  ·  10 traces  ·  28 findings
[Run Analysis ▾]  [Add Traces]  [⏸ Pause]  [Model: ▾]
```

- Stats are inline text, not stat cards
- "Run Analysis" is a dropdown that includes template selection (Evaluation Criteria / Themes & Patterns) and analysis history
- Model selector is a compact inline dropdown
- Pause/Resume is a toggle button
- "Add Traces" opens trace addition flow

### Cross-Trace Analysis Summary

Collapsible section between the overview bar and the trace feed. Only appears after analysis has been run.

- AI-generated summary text from the analysis
- Cross-trace findings (findings that reference multiple traces or no specific trace) with `[+ Add to Draft]` promote buttons
- "Linked to N traces" references on each finding (clickable to highlight those traces in the feed)
- Metadata: when analysis was run, which template, which model
- Note indicating how many trace-specific findings are shown on trace cards below
- Collapsible — facilitator can minimize after reviewing

### Trace Card (Standard Data Display)

The core building block of the workspace. Every trace is displayed consistently using a **standard trace card** format:

```
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Trace                                                     |
| USER: "What is the capital of France?"                    |
| ASSISTANT: "The capital of France is Paris. Paris is      |
|  the largest city..." [more]                              |
|                                                           |
| ANALYSIS FINDINGS (collapsible, pinned above feedback)    |
| ⚠ HIGH DISAGREEMENT                                      |
| Opposite ratings on accuracy vs. completeness             |
| Theme: "Brevity tolerance varies"        [+ Add to Draft] |
|                                                           |
| FEEDBACK (3)                                              |
| Alice · GOOD · "Clear and accurate"                       |
|   ▸ 3 follow-up Q&A (collapsible)                         |
| Bob · BAD · "Too terse, lacks context"                    |
|   ▸ 3 follow-up Q&A (collapsible)                         |
| Carol · GOOD · "Correct but could mention history"        |
|   ▸ 3 follow-up Q&A (collapsible)                         |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Information hierarchy within a trace card:**
1. **Trace content** — User input + assistant output, truncated with `[more]` expand
2. **Analysis findings** — Trace-specific findings and disagreements from the most recent analysis run. Collapsible, pinned above feedback. Only appears after analysis has been run. Each finding has a `[+ Add to Draft]` promote button.
3. **Participant feedback** — All feedback for this trace with reviewer name, colored label (GOOD/BAD), comment, and collapsible follow-up Q&A.

**Standard display rules:**
- Always show actual conversation content (input/output), not trace IDs
- Feedback shows: reviewer name + colored label (GOOD/BAD) + comment + collapsible Q&A
- Analysis findings include priority level, summary, theme, and promote button
- Trace IDs are never the primary identifier shown to users — the content is the identifier

### Promotion Flow

When the facilitator clicks `[+ Add to Draft]` on any finding (trace-specific or cross-trace):

1. Item appears in the draft rubric sidebar with a subtle arrival animation
2. Item text is pre-filled from the finding/disagreement summary
3. Item retains trace reference badges linking back to source traces
4. Facilitator can immediately edit the text in the sidebar

### Navigation Changes

| Old Flow | New Flow |
|----------|----------|
| Sidebar → "Discovery" → FacilitatorDashboard (discovery mode) | Sidebar → "Discovery" → FacilitatorDiscoveryWorkspace |
| Dashboard → "View All Findings" → FindingsReviewPage | Eliminated — findings are on the trace cards |
| FindingsReviewPage → "Analysis" tab → DiscoveryAnalysisTab | Eliminated — analysis results are co-located on trace cards and summary |
| Dashboard → "Draft Rubric" tab → DraftRubricPanel | Eliminated — draft rubric is the persistent sidebar |
| FindingsReviewPage → "Move to Rubric Creation" button | Sidebar → "Create Rubric →" button in draft rubric sidebar |

### Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **FacilitatorDiscoveryWorkspace** | Top-level page component, two-panel layout |
| **DiscoveryOverviewBar** | Compact stats + controls bar |
| **CrossTraceAnalysisSummary** | Collapsible global findings section |
| **DiscoveryTraceCard** | Standard trace display with feedback and findings |
| **DraftRubricSidebar** | Persistent right panel for draft rubric items |
| **TraceReferenceBadge** | Interactive compact trace reference (hover for content preview, click to scroll to trace in feed) |

### What Gets Removed

- "Quick actions" card from FacilitatorDashboard (replaced by overview bar)
- Source-type badges (Finding, Disagreement, Feedback, Manual) from draft items
- Tabs in FindingsReviewPage (All Findings, By Trace, By User, Analysis) — replaced by the trace feed
- Dashboard tabs for Feedback and Draft Rubric — these become the main content and sidebar
- Trace ID-only badges used as primary display — replaced by actual trace content

### What Gets Kept

- FacilitatorDashboard for annotation mode (unchanged)
- RubricCreationDemo page (receives pre-populated data from draft groups)
- Suggest Groups / Apply Groups AI functionality
- Phase control (pause/resume) functionality
- Analysis run API and history
- All backend services and API endpoints (unchanged)

## Trace Assignment & Ordering

> Folded in from the retired `DISCOVERY_TRACE_ASSIGNMENT_SPEC` (2026-06). Only the shipped mechanism is specified here. The dataset-composition model from that spec (union/subtract operations with audit trail, per-cohort assignment, phase/round metadata on assignments, randomization seeds that include phase/round) was never built and is roadmap — it carries no success criteria.

### Active Trace Lists

The workshop record holds the active trace selection per phase:

- `active_discovery_trace_ids` — set when the facilitator starts Discovery (`POST /workshops/{id}/begin-discovery`, optional `trace_limit` and `randomize`)
- `active_annotation_trace_ids` — set when annotation starts (`POST /workshops/{id}/begin-annotation`)

`GET /workshops/{id}/traces?user_id=...` requires a `user_id` and filters by phase:

- In the discovery phase, only traces in `active_discovery_trace_ids` are returned to participants
- In the annotation phase, only traces in `active_annotation_trace_ids` are returned
- Otherwise (facilitator management views), all traces are returned

Traces outside the active selection are hidden from participants but never deleted — `GET /workshops/{id}/all-traces` continues to return every trace in the workshop.

Resetting discovery (`POST /workshops/{id}/reset-discovery`) clears the active discovery list, per-user trace orders, findings, and completion records so the facilitator can re-select traces; starting discovery again establishes a new active list.

### Per-User Randomized Ordering

Annotation (and Discovery, when the randomize toggle is on) uses deterministic per-user trace ordering, persisted in `UserTraceOrder`:

```
seed = MD5(f"{user_id}::{','.join(sorted(trace_ids))}") % 2**31
random.Random(seed).shuffle(trace_ids)
```

Properties of the shipped algorithm (`DatabaseService._generate_randomized_trace_order`):

- Same user + same trace set → same order every time (stable across page reloads)
- Different users → different orders over the same trace set, which enables inter-rater reliability measurement
- Traces added mid-round are appended (in randomized order) after the user's existing order — already-seen traces are not reshuffled
- A different trace set yields a different seed → fresh randomization

## Backend Services

### FollowUpQuestionService
Generates progressive AI follow-up questions during Step 1 feedback collection.

```python
class FollowUpQuestionService:
    def generate(self, trace, feedback, question_number: int) -> str:
        """Generate follow-up question using LLM with progressive context.

        Builds a prompt with the trace, feedback label/comment, and all
        prior Q&A pairs so each question builds on previous answers.
        """
```

### DiscoveryAnalysisService
Aggregates feedback and runs LLM analysis with structured output via DSPy signatures.

```python
class DiscoveryAnalysisService:
    def aggregate_feedback(self, workshop_id: str) -> dict:
        """Group all feedback by trace_id with trace input/output."""

    def detect_disagreements(self, aggregated: dict) -> dict:
        """Detect 3 priority tiers of disagreements. Deterministic, no LLM."""

    def distill(self, template: str, aggregated: dict, disagreements: dict) -> DistillationOutput:
        """Call LLM with template-specific prompt. Returns structured output via DSPy.

        Args:
            template: 'evaluation_criteria' or 'themes_patterns'
            aggregated: Feedback grouped by trace
            disagreements: Detected disagreement tiers

        Returns:
            DistillationOutput with typed findings and disagreement analysis.
        """

    def run_analysis(self, workshop_id: str, template: str) -> DiscoveryAnalysis:
        """Full workflow: aggregate → detect → distill → store (new record)."""
```

#### DSPy Signatures for Structured Output

Rather than parsing free-form LLM markdown, the analysis pipeline uses DSPy signatures to get typed, structured output directly from the LLM.

```python
class Finding(BaseModel):
    text: str                    # Description of the finding
    evidence_trace_ids: list[str]  # Traces that support this finding
    priority: str                # 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'

class DisagreementAnalysis(BaseModel):
    trace_id: str
    summary: str                 # What they disagreed about
    underlying_theme: str        # Quality dimension at play
    followup_questions: list[str]  # Questions to resolve it
    facilitator_suggestions: list[str]  # Concrete calibration actions

class DistillationOutput(BaseModel):
    findings: list[Finding]
    high_priority_disagreements: list[DisagreementAnalysis]   # GOOD vs BAD
    medium_priority_disagreements: list[DisagreementAnalysis]  # Both BAD, different issues
    lower_priority_disagreements: list[DisagreementAnalysis]   # Both GOOD, different strengths
    summary: str                 # Brief overall summary

class DistillFindings(dspy.Signature):
    """Analyze participant feedback to extract findings and disagreement insights."""
    instruction: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Template-specific analysis instruction")
    feedback_data: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Aggregated feedback with trace context")
    detected_disagreements: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Pre-detected disagreement tiers")
    output: DistillationOutput = dspy.OutputField()
```

The `instruction` field receives the template-specific prompt (Evaluation Criteria or Themes & Patterns), keeping the signature reusable across templates.

### DraftRubricGroupingService
Suggests groupings of draft rubric items via LLM.

```python
class DraftRubricGroupingService:
    def suggest_groups(self, items: list[DraftRubricItem]) -> list[ProposedGroup]:
        """LLM clusters draft items into rubric question groups.

        Returns a proposal (not persisted). The facilitator reviews
        and calls apply_groups() to persist.
        """

    def apply_groups(self, workshop_id: str, groups: list[dict]) -> None:
        """Persist group assignments. Updates group_id/group_name on each item."""
```

#### DSPy Signature for Group Suggestion

```python
class ProposedGroup(BaseModel):
    name: str                    # Suggested rubric question title
    item_ids: list[str]          # Draft item IDs in this group
    rationale: str               # Why these items belong together

class SuggestGroups(dspy.Signature):
    """Cluster related draft rubric items into groups, where each group
    will become one rubric question."""
    items: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Draft rubric items with IDs and text")
    groups: list[ProposedGroup] = dspy.OutputField()
```

## System Prompts

### Follow-Up Question Generation

Prompt lives in the `GenerateFollowUpQuestion` DSPy signature docstring. See [Follow-Up Question Generation](#follow-up-question-generation) for the structured InputFields.

### Analysis Template: Evaluation Criteria
Used when `template = 'evaluation_criteria'`. Passed as the `instruction` field to the `DistillFindings` DSPy signature.

```
Analyze the participant feedback below to extract evaluation criteria and
analyze disagreements between reviewers.

## Findings: Evaluation Criteria

Distill specific, actionable evaluation criteria from the feedback. Each
criterion should describe one quality dimension that could be used to assess
future responses. Focus on:
- User preferences and expectations for quality
- Specific aspects users care about (tone, accuracy, efficiency, empathy, etc.)
- Patterns in what makes responses "good" vs "needs improvement"

For each criterion, cite the trace IDs that provide evidence and assign a
priority (high/medium/low) based on how frequently or strongly it appears
in the feedback.

## Disagreement Analysis

For each detected disagreement, analyze:
- HIGH PRIORITY (rating disagreements — one GOOD, one BAD): What quality
  dimension is unclear? What follow-up questions would resolve it? What
  concrete calibration actions should the facilitator take?
- MEDIUM PRIORITY (both BAD, different issues): What different problems
  were identified? Are they independent or related? Which should be fixed
  first?
- LOWER PRIORITY (both GOOD, different strengths): What different aspects
  were valued? Do these reflect different user types or priorities?
```

### Analysis Template: Themes & Patterns
Used when `template = 'themes_patterns'`. Same DSPy signature, different instruction.

```
Analyze the participant feedback below to identify recurring themes and
patterns, and analyze disagreements between reviewers.

## Findings: Themes & Patterns

Identify emergent themes, recurring patterns, notable tendencies, risks,
and strengths across the feedback. Unlike formal criteria, themes can be
broader observations about how users interact with and evaluate the
responses. Look for:
- Recurring concerns or praise across multiple traces
- Patterns in what users notice first or care most about
- Tendencies in how different user types evaluate responses
- Risks or failure modes that appeared across traces
- Strengths worth preserving

For each theme, cite the trace IDs that provide evidence and assign a
priority (high/medium/low) based on prevalence and impact.

## Disagreement Analysis

For each detected disagreement, analyze:
- HIGH PRIORITY (rating disagreements — one GOOD, one BAD): What
  underlying theme explains the split? What perspectives are in tension?
- MEDIUM PRIORITY (both BAD, different issues): What different themes
  do the issues fall under? Are they facets of the same problem?
- LOWER PRIORITY (both GOOD, different strengths): What different
  themes do the valued aspects represent?
```

### Suggest Groups Prompt
Used as context for the `SuggestGroups` DSPy signature.

```
You are organizing draft rubric items into groups. Each group will become
one rubric question for evaluating chatbot responses.

Group items that address the same quality dimension or evaluation concern.
Each group should be:
- Cohesive: all items in a group relate to the same core idea
- Distinct: groups should not overlap significantly
- Named clearly: the group name should work as a rubric question title

Items that don't fit any group can be left ungrouped. Prefer fewer,
well-defined groups over many small ones.
```

## Configuration

### LLM Provider
Discovery uses the same model selection as judge evaluation: **Databricks foundation models** (via `modelMapping.ts`) and optionally a **Custom LLM Provider** (via `CustomLLMProviderConfig`). The facilitator picks a model in the Discovery dashboard UI. No discovery-specific LLM configuration needed.

### Dev Instrumentation
When the `MLFLOW_DSPY_DEV_EXPERIMENT_ID` environment variable is set, the discovery DSPy infrastructure (`server/services/discovery_dspy.py`) enables MLflow DSPy autologging against that experiment. When the variable is unset, autologging is a no-op.

### Defaults
- **Trace limit**: 10 (configurable by facilitator)
- **Follow-up questions**: 3 per trace (legacy path; can be disabled)
- **All questions required** (no skip)
- **Randomization**: Off by default
- **Discovery mode**: `analysis` (existing findings/promotion UX) or `social` (threaded collaboration UX)
- **Assistant mentions**: Facilitator can invoke `@assistant` fixed intents (`summarize thread`, `tools at milestone`). Responses are deterministic templates — no LLM (LLM-backed replies are roadmap).
- **Agent mentions**: Facilitator can invoke `@agent` bounded tool loop with streamed progress and output. The loop is a deterministic pass over trace-context tools — no LLM tool-calling (roadmap).

## Success Criteria

<SpecCoverage spec="DISCOVERY_SPEC" />


### Step 1: Feedback Collection (#81)
- [ ] Facilitator can start Discovery phase with configurable trace limit


- [ ] Participants view traces and provide GOOD/BAD + comment
- [ ] Facilitator can select LLM model for follow-up question generation in Discovery dashboard
- [ ] AI generates 3 follow-up questions per trace based on feedback
- [ ] Questions build progressively on prior answers
- [ ] All 3 questions required before moving to next trace
- [ ] Previous Q&A visible while answering new questions
- [ ] Loading spinner during LLM generation (1-3s)
- [ ] Error handling with retry for LLM failures
- [ ] Feedback saved incrementally (no data loss on failure)
- [ ] Completion status shows % of participants finished
- [ ] Facilitator can view participant feedback details (label, comment, follow-up Q&A)

### Step 2: Findings Synthesis (#82)
- [ ] Facilitator can trigger analysis at any time (even partial feedback)
- [ ] Facilitator selects analysis template (Evaluation Criteria or Themes & Patterns) before running
- [ ] System aggregates feedback by trace
- [ ] Disagreements detected at 3 priority levels (deterministic, no LLM)
- [ ] LLM distills evaluation criteria with evidence from trace IDs
- [ ] LLM analyzes disagreements with follow-up questions and suggestions
- [ ] Analysis record stores which template was used
- [ ] Each analysis run creates a new record (history preserved)
- [ ] Re-runnable — new analysis as more feedback comes in, prior analyses retained
- [ ] Warning if < 2 participants (not an error)
<!-- AUDIT: live regression, owner decision pending — the backend computes the warning data,
     but FacilitatorDiscoveryWorkspace does not render a <2-participant warning. Backend tags
     below this criterion are truthful for the data layer only. -->
- [ ] Data freshness banner (participant count, last run timestamp)
- [ ] Results organized by priority (HIGH → MEDIUM → LOWER)

### Step 3: Structured Feedback & Promotion (#13)
- [ ] Facilitator can promote distilled criteria to draft rubric
- [ ] Facilitator can promote disagreement insights to draft rubric
- [ ] Facilitator can promote raw participant feedback to draft rubric
- [ ] Facilitator can manually add draft rubric items
- [ ] Draft rubric items editable and removable
- [ ] "Suggest Groups" returns LLM proposal without persisting
- [ ] Facilitator can review, adjust, and apply group proposal
- [ ] Manual grouping: create groups, name them, move items between groups
- [ ] Each group maps to one rubric question (group name = question title)
- [ ] Draft rubric items available during Rubric Creation phase
- [ ] Source traceability maintained (which traces support each item)

### Step 4: Social Threads & Mentions (#new)

<!-- AUDIT (2026-06): the shipped @assistant/@agent responders are deterministic template
     stubs — no LLM is invoked. The criteria below cover only the shipped thread/mention
     mechanics. LLM-backed assistant/agent capabilities live under "### Roadmap". -->

- [ ] Facilitator can switch Discovery workspace between `analysis` mode and `social` mode
- [ ] In social mode, users can create trace-level comments
- [ ] In social mode, users can create milestone-level comments
- [ ] Users can reply to comments in-thread
- [ ] Users can upvote/downvote comments (single vote per user per comment with toggle behavior)
- [ ] Thread updates appear live in the workspace while participants collaborate
- [ ] Facilitator can moderate social discussion threads by deleting comments
- [ ] Only facilitator can delete social thread comments
- [ ] Non-facilitator mentions do not trigger assistant/agent execution (treated as plain text mentions)
- [ ] Facilitator `@assistant` mentions post an automated assistant reply in-thread (deterministic template stub)
- [ ] Facilitator can invoke `@agent` to run a bounded tool loop and receive a persisted agent reply in-thread with clear success/failure status
- [ ] `@agent` run lifecycle is visible (`running`, `completed`, `failed`, `timeout`) with final persisted reply

### Data Integrity
- [ ] One feedback record per (workshop, trace, user) — upsert behavior
- [ ] Q&A pairs appended in order to JSON array
- [ ] Multiple analysis records per workshop allowed (history preserved)
- [ ] Draft rubric items track promotion source and promoter

### Trace Assignment & Ordering
- [ ] Participants only see traces in the current active discovery trace list
- [ ] Traces outside the active discovery selection are hidden from participants but not deleted
- [ ] Annotation trace order is deterministic per user and persists across page reloads
- [ ] Annotators see the same trace set in different per-user orders, enabling inter-rater reliability measurement
- [ ] Adding annotation traces mid-round appends them without reshuffling a user's existing order
- [ ] Changing the annotation trace set produces a fresh randomized order

### Instrumentation
- [ ] DSPy MLflow autologging activates only when MLFLOW_DSPY_DEV_EXPERIMENT_ID is set

### Error Handling
- [ ] LLM failures show error toast with retry
- [ ] Fallback question if LLM unavailable after retries
- [ ] Fallback warning banner shown only to facilitators, never to participants/SMEs
- [ ] Analysis shows warning (not error) if < 2 participants
<!-- AUDIT: live regression, owner decision pending — no <2-participant warning is rendered
     in the live FacilitatorDiscoveryWorkspace (the DiscoveryAnalysisTab that rendered it is
     no longer mounted). Backend tag covers the service-level behavior only. -->
- [ ] Form validation prevents empty submissions

### UX — Participant
- [ ] Progressive disclosure (one question at a time)
- [ ] Submit buttons disabled until required fields filled
- [ ] Clear progress indication (X of Y traces completed)
- [ ] Smooth transitions between feedback states
- [ ] When follow-up questions are disabled, participant flow is GOOD/BAD + comment only

### UX — Facilitator Discovery Workspace
- [ ] Single two-panel workspace replaces multi-page flow (no FacilitatorDashboard discovery tabs, no FindingsReviewPage)
- [ ] Trace feed shows actual trace content (input/output), not trace ID badges
- [ ] Trace-specific analysis findings appear on the trace card, pinned above feedback (collapsible)
- [ ] Cross-trace analysis findings appear in collapsible summary section above the feed
- [ ] Overview bar shows stats inline + compact controls (Run Analysis, Add Traces, Pause, Model selector)
- [ ] Draft rubric sidebar is always visible while browsing traces
- [ ] Promote action visibly moves items from trace feed/summary into the sidebar
- [ ] Draft rubric items show trace reference badges (interactive: hover for preview, click to scroll)
<!-- AUDIT: spec drift, owner decision pending — no TraceReferenceBadge component exists; the
     live DraftRubricSidebar renders inline markdown origin links (click routes to origin)
     instead of hover-preview badges. Criterion left in place, currently uncovered. -->
- [ ] Draft rubric items do NOT show source-type badges (Finding, Disagreement, etc.)
- [ ] Disagreements color-coded by priority (red/yellow/blue) on trace cards
<!-- AUDIT: live regression, owner decision pending — DiscoveryTraceCard renders all
     disagreement priorities in rose instead of red/yellow/blue by priority. False green
     tags (unmounted DiscoveryAnalysisTab vitest, backend data-shape test) were removed. -->
- [ ] "Create Rubric →" in sidebar transitions to rubric creation with groups pre-populated as criteria

### Roadmap

> Not shipped in v1.10. The live `@assistant`/`@agent` implementation is a deterministic
> template stub with no LLM behind it — these criteria describe the intended LLM-backed
> capability and are excluded from the coverage denominator.

- [ ] Facilitator `@assistant summarize this thread` returns a grounded summary as a thread reply (roadmap)
- [ ] Facilitator `@assistant` tool-availability questions for a milestone return grounded context as a thread reply (roadmap)
- [ ] Facilitator `@agent` starts a bounded tool-calling run and posts streamed partial output in the thread (roadmap)
- [ ] Social mode provides a modern live collaboration experience with streamed in-thread updates for assistant/agent responses (roadmap)

## Existing Code Reference

The `feat/discovery-update` branch (v1 assisted facilitation) is merged. Most code needs replacing for the v2 feedback-based approach. Reusable parts:

**Reuse as-is:**
- `discovery_dspy.py` — DSPy infrastructure: `build_databricks_lm`, `get_predictor`, `run_predict`, `_dspy_with_lm`
- `discovery_service.py` — `begin_discovery_phase`, `reset_discovery`, `advance_to_discovery`, completion tracking methods
- `discovery.py` router — `begin-discovery`, `reset-discovery`, `advance-to-discovery`, completion endpoints
- `DiscoveryStartPage.tsx`, `DiscoveryPendingPage.tsx` — adapt for new config options (randomization toggle)

**Replace:**
- v1 question generation (coverage-category system) → v2 follow-up question generation (progressive Q&A)
- v1 summary pipeline (iterative refine/extract/disagree/discuss) → v2 analysis templates with `DistillFindings` DSPy signature
- v1 classification service (`classification_service.py`) → v2 deterministic disagreement detection
- v1 DSPy signatures → v2 signatures (`DistillFindings`, `SuggestGroups`)
- `TraceDiscoveryPanel.tsx` → `DiscoveryFeedbackView`, `DiscoveryDashboard`, Draft Rubric Panel
- `DiscoveryService.ts` → new API client for v2 endpoints
- DB migration — new migration needed for `discovery_feedback`, `discovery_analysis`, `draft_rubric_items` tables

**Reference only (not merged to main):**
- `pk-changes/` — colleague's prototype with sample prompts, feedback flow, and analysis output

## Workflow Integration

### Phase Order
```
intake → discovery → rubric_creation → annotation → judge_tuning
```

Discovery replaces the previous discovery phase. No separate "pre-work" phase.

### RoleBasedWorkflow Routing
```tsx
if (phase === 'discovery') {
  if (isFacilitator) {
    if (!workshop.discovery_started) {
      return <DiscoveryStartPage />;
    } else {
      // Single workspace: trace feed + analysis + draft rubric sidebar
      return <FacilitatorDiscoveryWorkspace />;
    }
  } else {
    if (!workshop.discovery_started) {
      return <DiscoveryPendingPage />;
    } else if (userCompleted) {
      return <DiscoveryCompletePage />;
    } else {
      return <DiscoveryFeedbackView />;
    }
  }
}
```
