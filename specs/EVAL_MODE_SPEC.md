# EVAL_MODE_SPEC

## Overview

Eval Mode is an alternative workshop mode where evaluation criteria are authored **per-trace** rather than globally. It enables building offline evaluation harnesses from specific examples.

In the standard workshop mode, rubrics must generalize across all traces — criteria like "if budget is $500–800, recommend a laptop with 16GB RAM" under a "Budget Awareness" judge. In eval mode, criteria are example-specific: "the agent found laptops with at least 16GB of RAM." This works because each criterion has a concrete trace as its reference, so you know exactly what correct looks like.

The per-trace criteria ARE the ground truth, but the validation pipeline remains the same as workshop mode: **Rubric Creation → Annotation → Results Review (IRR) → Judge Alignment**. All of this is already built into the workshop, but eval mode applies it per-trace rather than across all examples with a shared rubric.

### Inspiration

- **HealthBench** ([arXiv:2505.08775](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08775)): Per-example rubrics with signed point values (-10 to +10), positive and negative criteria, additive weighted scoring. Average 11.4 criteria per example. One judge call per criterion.
- **ACE** ([arXiv:2512.04921](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04921)): Per-example rubrics with hurdle criteria (must-pass gates) and grounding checks against external data. Hierarchical gating model where hurdle failure → score 0.

## Core Concepts

### Workshop Mode

Workshops have a `mode` selected at creation time:

| Mode | Rubric Scope | Ground Truth | Goal |
|------|-------------|--------------|------|
| `workshop` (default) | Global — one rubric for all traces | Established through human-human IRR | Consensus criteria + aligned judge |
| `eval` | Per-trace — each trace gets its own criteria | The criteria themselves | Offline eval harness |

Mode is immutable after creation.

### Per-Example Rubric

Each trace in an eval-mode workshop has its own rubric — a markdown-formatted document containing the evaluation criteria for that specific example. The rubric is authored through the discovery and promotion flow: participants examine a trace, submit findings, and the facilitator promotes findings into criteria.

The rubric is stored as markdown, enabling rich formatting:

```markdown
## Criteria

### [HURDLE] Correctly identifies the medical emergency
The response must recognize that the described symptoms (sudden onset weakness,
facial drooping, slurred speech) indicate a possible stroke and treat this as
an urgent medical situation.

**Weight: gate**

### States that the infant may have muscle weakness
The response should mention hypotonia or muscle weakness as a potential
symptom associated with the described condition.

**Weight: +7**

### Recommends unnecessary invasive procedure
The response should NOT recommend lumbar puncture or other invasive
diagnostic procedures given the clinical presentation.

**Weight: -5**
```

### Criterion Types

Two types that affect scoring logic:

| Type | Behavior | Score Values | Example |
|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Standard** | Binary pass/fail with signed weight | 0 (not met) or 1 (met) × weight | "States the infant may have muscle weakness" (+7) |
| **Hurdle** | Must-pass gate — if fails, entire trace scores 0 | pass/fail (no point value) | "Correctly identifies the medical emergency" |

Standard criteria can have negative weights (HealthBench pattern) to penalize undesirable behaviors: "Recommends an unnecessary procedure" (-5).

### Scoring Aggregation

Hierarchical gating (ACE) combined with weighted sum (HealthBench):

```
1. Evaluate hurdle criteria
   → ANY hurdle fails → trace score = 0, stop

2. Evaluate standard criteria
   → score_i = met_i × weight_i    (met_i is 0 or 1)

3. Aggregate
   → raw_score  = sum(score_i for positive weights where met)
                 + sum(score_i for negative weights where met)
   → max_possible = sum(weight_i for positive weights)
   → normalized_score = raw_score / max_possible   (clipped to [0, 1])
```

A trace can score below 0 before clipping if negative-weight criteria dominate.

### Judge Execution

One independent judge call per criterion. The judge sees:
- The trace content (via summary or full trace)
- A single criterion statement
- NOT other criteria or their scores

This matches both HealthBench and ACE methodology.

## Behavior

### Workshop Creation

When creating a workshop with `mode: "eval"`:
- No global rubric is created (the `rubric` table is unused)
- The annotation phase is replaced by a criterion-authoring and judge-evaluation flow
- Trace assignment, ingestion, and summarization work identically to workshop mode

### Per-Trace Workflow

```
For each trace:
  1. Trace displayed with summary/milestone view
  2. Discovery → findings (using trace summaries or agent loop)
  3. Facilitator promotes findings → per-trace criteria
     - Assigns type (standard or hurdle)
     - Assigns weight (-10 to +10) for standard criteria
     - Edits criterion text for clarity
  4. Human reviews criteria quality — clear, complete, correct?
  5. Move to next trace

After criteria authored:
  6. Judge runs blind against all criteria (one call per criterion)
  7. Results available for review — refine criteria judges struggle with
  8. Export as offline eval harness
```

### Discovery Improvements

The current discovery classification sees only trace input/output. In eval mode, analysis prompts should use:
- **Trace summaries** from the summarization pipeline (executive summary + milestones), or
- **Agent loops** over trace spans using the same tool-based approach as the summarizer (get_trace_overview, list_spans, get_span_detail, etc.)

This produces richer, more specific findings that map naturally to per-trace criteria. This improvement applies to eval mode primarily but could benefit workshop mode in the future.

### Criteria Authoring

Criteria are authored through two paths:

1. **Promoted from discovery**: A finding is promoted and the facilitator assigns type and weight. The finding text becomes the criterion text (editable).

2. **Direct authoring**: The facilitator writes a criterion directly on a trace without going through discovery. This supports adding criteria that weren't surfaced as findings.

### Judge Evaluation

**Status:** Partially built. Evaluation storage (`CriterionEvaluation`) and score aggregation over stored evaluations are implemented; judge *execution* (LLM calls per criterion, background job, blind review) is roadmap — see [Roadmap](#roadmap).

After criteria are authored for one or more traces, the facilitator can trigger judge evaluation:

1. System iterates over each trace with criteria
2. For each criterion, an independent judge call evaluates whether the trace meets it
3. Judge returns: met (boolean) + rationale (text)
4. Scoring aggregation applies hurdle gating then weighted sum
5. Results stored per-criterion with rationale

Judge scores are optionally hidden from the human reviewer to prevent anchoring.

### Judge Alignment (MemAlign)

**Status:** Roadmap — not implemented. Depends on the upstream `trace_to_dspy_example` multi-assessment change described below. See [Roadmap](#roadmap).

Eval mode aligns a single **task-level judge** using MemAlign, where every criterion evaluation across all traces feeds into alignment as a separate example.

#### Mental Model

```
task_1_judge
  ├── trace_1 (50 traces × ~10 criteria = ~500 alignment examples)
  │     ├── criterion: "identifies budget constraint"  → met ✓ (human)
  │     ├── criterion: "recommends 16GB RAM"           → met ✓ (human)
  │     └── criterion: "stays under budget"            → not met ✗ (human)
  ├── trace_2
  │     ├── criterion: "lists at least 3 options"      → met ✓ (human)
  │     └── criterion: "includes price comparison"     → met ✓ (human)
  └── ...
```

One judge per task. All criterion met/not-met human decisions are written as separate MLflow assessments on the trace, sharing the judge name. This produces far more alignment examples than workshop mode (N criteria per trace vs. 1 rating per trace).

#### How MemAlign Uses Criteria

**Semantic memory (guidelines):** Criteria that recur across traces — "respects stated budget" appearing on multiple shopping traces — are distilled into transferable guidelines about what the judge should look for across the task.

**Episodic memory (examples):** Non-overlapping, highly specific criteria — "recommends the Sennheiser HD 560S given the stated preference for open-back headphones" — become episodic examples retrieved by embedding similarity at inference time.

#### Assessment Storage

Each criterion's human decision is written as a separate MLflow assessment on the trace:

```python
# For each criterion on a trace:
mlflow.log_assessment(
    trace_id=trace_id,
    name=judge_name,          # Same name for all criteria under this judge
    source_type="HUMAN",
    value=met,                # bool: True/False
    rationale=criterion_text, # The criterion itself serves as rationale
)
```

#### Upstream Requirement: `trace_to_dspy_example` Multi-Assessment Support

MemAlign's `trace_to_dspy_example` (dspy_utils.py:338) currently takes the **most recent** human assessment per trace when multiple match the judge name. This discards all but one criterion assessment per trace.

**Required change:** `trace_to_dspy_example` must yield all matching HUMAN assessments per trace as separate `dspy.Example` objects, not just the most recent. The rest of the MemAlign pipeline (episodic embedding, guideline distillation, inference retrieval) already consumes a flat list of examples, so nothing downstream changes.

This change also fixes **judge re-hydration** — when a registered judge is loaded and rebuilds episodic memory by re-walking traces, it needs to recover all criterion-level examples, not just one per trace.

**Status:** Candidate for upstreaming to MLflow once validated in this system.

#### Alignment Flow

```
1. Human reviews judge's criterion evaluations, corrects met/not-met where wrong
2. Corrected decisions written as HUMAN assessments on traces (one per criterion)
3. Traces tagged with 'align' label
4. MemAlign optimizer called with task-level judge
5. trace_to_dspy_example extracts ALL criterion assessments per trace (upstream change)
6. Semantic memory: distill guidelines from overlapping criteria patterns
7. Episodic memory: embed specific criterion examples for retrieval
8. Aligned judge registered to MLflow
9. Re-evaluate to compare pre/post alignment accuracy
```

#### Re-Hydration

When the aligned judge is loaded (via `get_scorer` or re-instantiation), episodic memory is rebuilt by re-walking traces. Because all criterion assessments are stored on the traces and the extraction yields all of them, re-hydration reconstructs the full example set without our system needing to maintain a separate store.

### Offline Eval Export

**Status:** Roadmap — not implemented. See [Roadmap](#roadmap).

The output is a mapping of `{trace_id → [criteria]}` plus the configuration to re-run evaluation:

- Trace identifiers (MLflow trace IDs or local IDs)
- Per-trace criteria with types and weights
- Judge prompt template
- Model endpoint configuration
- Scoring aggregation rules

The simplest version is a script that loads trace data, runs `mlflow.genai.evaluate()` with one scorer per criterion, and applies the aggregation.

### Judge Evaluation
- [ ] Results stored per-criterion with rationale
- [ ] Aggregated eval scores are available per trace or for all workshop traces

### Roadmap

Design intent for behavior that is not yet built. These items are not success
criteria for the current implementation and do not count toward coverage;
promote an item back to a `- [ ]` criterion when the behavior ships.

**Judge execution**
- One independent judge call per criterion
- Judge sees trace content + single criterion, not other criteria
- Judge returns met (boolean) + rationale
- Evaluation runs as background job with progress tracking
- Judge scores optionally hidden from human reviewer

**Judge alignment (MemAlign)** — blocked on the upstream `trace_to_dspy_example` multi-assessment change
- One task-level judge aligned using all criteria across all traces as examples
- Each criterion's human met/not-met decision stored as a separate MLflow assessment on the trace
- All assessments share the judge name; extraction yields all (not just most recent)
- Semantic memory distills guidelines from overlapping criteria patterns
- Episodic memory indexes specific criterion examples for retrieval
- Aligned judge registered to MLflow
- Re-hydration rebuilds episodic memory from trace assessments without external state
- Re-evaluation compares pre/post alignment accuracy on same trace set

**Offline eval export**
- Export produces trace → criteria mapping
- Export includes scoring configuration (types, weights, aggregation rules)
- Exported eval can be re-run via `mlflow.genai.evaluate()`

## Future Work

- **Grounding checks**: ACE-style criterion type that verifies claims against external data sources. Three-valued scoring (+1 verified, 0 not met, -1 contradicted). ACE's grounding was against web sources; an analog for trace data (verifying that a claimed action actually appears in trace spans) could also be explored.
- **Consensus criteria**: Pre-written criteria that can be assigned to multiple traces when domain experts agree they're relevant (HealthBench pattern — their 34 consensus criteria).
- **Criterion difficulty analysis**: Track which criteria judges consistently struggle with to identify ambiguous or poorly-written criteria.
- **Batch rubric generation**: AI-assisted criterion generation from discovery findings (extending existing rubric suggestion flow to per-trace context).
- **Eval harness versioning**: Track changes to criteria over time and compare judge performance across versions.
- **Workshop-to-eval migration**: Convert a workshop-mode rubric into per-trace criteria by specializing general criteria to specific examples.
