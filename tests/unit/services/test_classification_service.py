"""Tests for the dormant v1 classification service local fallback.

NOTE: Real-time finding classification never shipped to the UI. The
ASSISTED_FACILITATION_SPEC was retired (folded into DISCOVERY_SPEC as
roadmap), so these tests carry no spec tags — they remain as regression
coverage for the retained `_classify_finding_locally` fallback code.
