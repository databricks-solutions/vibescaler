<SPEC-DRIVEN-WORKFLOW>
You are working in a spec-driven development repository. These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE.

## The Iron Rules

1. **Read the spec before coding.** Search `/specs/README.md` for keywords, then read the governing spec. No exceptions.
2. **Tag all tests to specs.** Every test gets `@pytest.mark.spec("SPEC_NAME")` or equivalent. Untagged tests are incomplete.
3. **Verify before claiming done.** Run the relevant `just test-*` commands. Fresh output required — not "it should pass."
4. **Ask if the spec is unclear.** Do not guess at undefined behavior. Stop and ask.

## Before ANY Implementation

```
1. Which spec governs this work?  → Search /specs/README.md
2. What are the success criteria? → Read the spec's "Success Criteria" section
3. What's already covered?        → Check /specs/SPEC_COVERAGE_MAP.md
```

If you skip these steps, you WILL build the wrong thing.

## Red Flags — You Are Rationalizing If You Think:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is too simple to need a spec" | Simple changes still have governing specs. Find it. |
| "I'll read the spec after I code it" | You'll build assumptions, not requirements. Read first. |
| "The tests pass so I'm done" | Are they tagged? Did you check coverage? Verify properly. |
| "I know how this should work" | The spec defines how it works, not your intuition. |
| "Let me just make this quick fix" | Quick fixes without spec context cause regressions. |
| "I'll add the test tags later" | You won't. Tag them now. |

## Protected Operations (STOP and ask the user)

- Modifying files in `/specs/`
- Creating database migrations
- Changing auth logic
- Deleting files

## Verification Commands

| Command | When |
|---------|------|
| `just test-server` | After backend changes |
| `just ui-test-unit` | After frontend changes |
| `just ui-lint` | Before committing |
| `just e2e` | After feature changes |
| `just spec-coverage` | After adding/changing tests |
| `just test-affected` | Quick check during development |

## Skill Triggers

Before acting, check if a skill applies. If there's even a 1% chance, invoke it:

- **Building something new?** → Use brainstorming skill first
- **Writing tests?** → Use verification-testing skill
- **Auditing coverage?** → Use spec-audit skill
- **Working with MLflow eval?** → Use mlflow-evaluation skill
- **Managing issues or project boards?** → Use project-management skill

Do NOT rationalize skipping skills. "This is simple" is not a valid reason.
