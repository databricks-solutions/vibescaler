# V2 Workshop Creation Refactor

**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Status:** Draft — awaiting Phase 0 spec revisions and user approval before code work
**Branch:** `feat/social-mode` (work-in-progress; coordinate with existing `SprintWorkspacePage` route)
**Inputs:**
- `.claude/plans/2026-04-27-v2-first-principles-architecture.md` (V2 shape; ownership model)
- `.claude/plans/2026-04-27-v2-codebase-audit-keep-cut-refactor.md` (keep/cut/refactor signals)
- `.claude/plans/2026-04-27-v2-sprint-primitive-design.md` (locked V2 design)

---

## Goal

Reshape the **workshop creation surface** to match V2:
- Workshop becomes a **thin container** (name, description, facilitator_id, mode, MLflow intake config) with no phase machinery and no bootstrap of sub-resources.
- Identity stays in Databricks; Trace and Judge stay in MLflow; Rubric stays a local entity (versioning deferred).
- Phase-advance endpoints retire; sprint state replaces them downstream.
- Sweep the creation-adjacent debt at the same time.

## Architecture (3 sentences)

V1 modeled `Workshop` as a phase-keyed god-entity that embedded rubric text, judge name, phase flags, active trace ID lists, and discovery/annotation config inline. V2 strips it to a thin container — name, description, facilitator, mode, MLflow source — with all phase machinery and runtime config moving to a future `Sprint` primitive. Workshop creation becomes a single insert; rubric/judge/trace/participant inclusion is a **sprint-time** concern, not a workshop-creation concern, because those entities belong to MLflow / Databricks (or are deferred local entities).

## Out of scope (follow-on plans)

- **Sprint state machine, recommender, SME feed, procrastinate workers** — full V2 runtime
- **Trace catalog redesign** — `TraceDB` stays as today's MLflow projection per "leave unchanged for now"
- **Rubric versioning + cross-workshop reuse** — deferred per user direction
- **Judge MLflow-interop layer reshape** — `JudgePromptDB` stays as-is; reframed as MLflow interop record in a later plan
- **`discovery_feedback.followup_qna` → `discovery_comment` migration** — orthogonal
- **`database_service.py` / `routers/workshops.py` monolith split** — independently large; separate plan
- **Three Known Discrepancies** other than `update_workshop_participant`:
  - Phase-advance role enforcement → **resolved by removing phase-advance endpoints in this plan**
  - `can_annotate` check on `POST /annotations` → orthogonal; defer

## In-flight coordination

Before Phase 3, **stop and confirm with the user**:
- `client/src/App.tsx:71` already routes `/workshop/:workshopId` → `SprintWorkspacePage` (added on `feat/social-mode`).
- Is `SprintWorkspacePage` load-bearing or scaffolding?
- Should the new `WorkshopConfiguratorPage` route to `/workshop/:id` after create, hand off to `SprintWorkspacePage`, or land somewhere else?

## Governing specs

V2 entities get **new dedicated specs**. Existing specs lose content where the new spec takes over — they don't gain V2 sidecar sections.

| Spec | Status | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `WORKSHOP_SPEC.md` | **NEW (drafted in Phase 0)** | Defines V2 Workshop entity, creation flow, participant role assignment, MLflow intake config, and explicit references to (but not ownership of) Trace, Judge, Rubric, Sprint |
| `DISCOVERY_SPEC.md` | Existing — content removed | Strip the phase-machine narrative (intake → discovery → rubric → annotation → results → judge_tuning) and any workshop-creation guidance. Discovery becomes a sprint-time concern, governed by future `SPRINT_SPEC`/`DISCOVERY_SPEC` revision. |
| `ROLE_PERMISSIONS_SPEC.md` | Existing — content removed | Remove phase-advance permission rules. Workshop participant role assignment moves to `WORKSHOP_SPEC`. Close the `update_workshop_participant` Known Discrepancy. |

`RUBRIC_SPEC`, `JUDGE_EVALUATION_SPEC`, `TRACE_INGESTION_SPEC`, `DISCOVERY_TRACE_ASSIGNMENT_SPEC`, `EVAL_MODE_SPEC` are **not touched** in this plan (per scope).

## Success Criteria Targeted

All criteria live in the new `WORKSHOP_SPEC`. Verbatim text fills in during Phase 0 — behavior placeholders below.

- **SC-W1**: Workshop entity has fields `{id, name, description, facilitator_id, mode, created_at}` plus optional MLflow intake config; no phase machinery.
- **SC-W2**: `POST /workshops` accepts `{name, description?, facilitator_id, mode?}` and returns a Workshop with `id` and a clean V2 schema.
- **SC-W3**: Workshop response excludes `current_phase`, `completed_phases`, `discovery_started`, `annotation_started`, `active_*_trace_ids`, `discovery_*` config, and `annotation_randomize_traces`.
- **SC-W4**: Workshop participants are assigned roles (facilitator | sme | participant) via `WorkshopParticipant` mapping Databricks user identity (email) × workshop × role. Updates persist (closes `update_workshop_participant` no-op).
- **SC-W5**: Phase-advance endpoints (`/advance-to-discovery`, `/complete-phase/{phase}`, `/resume-phase/{phase}`) are removed; sprint state transitions replace them in a downstream plan.
- **SC-W6**: `mode` is immutable after creation (consistent with `EVAL_MODE_SPEC`).

## Phase 0 (BLOCKING, PROTECTED): Spec authorship

`/specs/` edits are a protected operation. Each task below produces a draft for user approval; no `/specs/` writes happen until the user signs off.

### Task 0.1: Draft `WORKSHOP_SPEC.md` (new)

- [ ] Author the new spec covering: Overview, Boundary cross-refs, Core Concepts (Workshop as thin container; mode; participant role; MLflow intake config), Data Model (`Workshop`, `WorkshopCreate`, `WorkshopParticipant`), Behavior (creation, role assignment, listing/reading, deletion), Permissions, API surface, Success Criteria (SC-W1..W6), Implementation Log
- [ ] Reference but do not own: `Trace` (MLflow), `Judge` (MLflow), `Rubric` (local; deferred), `Sprint` (downstream)
- [ ] Present full draft to user; wait for approval before writing to `/specs/WORKSHOP_SPEC.md`
- [ ] Update `/specs/README.md` keyword index to include the new spec

### Task 0.2: Strip superseded content from `DISCOVERY_SPEC.md`

- [ ] Remove the phase-machine narrative (intake → discovery → rubric → annotation → results → judge_tuning) wherever it appears as workshop lifecycle
- [ ] Remove Discovery's references to workshop creation (creation now governed by `WORKSHOP_SPEC`)
- [ ] Discovery itself stays — but reframed as a sprint-time activity (a fuller revision lands when the sprint runtime is planned; this pass only removes content `WORKSHOP_SPEC` takes over)
- [ ] Present diff; wait for approval

### Task 0.3: Strip superseded content from `ROLE_PERMISSIONS_SPEC.md`

- [ ] Remove phase-advance permission rules (advancement is a sprint concern; specifics live in `SPRINT_SPEC` when authored)
- [ ] Remove workshop participant role-assignment rules — those move to `WORKSHOP_SPEC` (cross-reference instead)
- [ ] Close the `update_workshop_participant` Known Discrepancy (`specs/README.md:379`) — note the fix lands in this plan's Phase 1.4
- [ ] Mark the phase-advance role-check Known Discrepancy as **resolved by endpoint removal** (this plan's Phase 2.2)
- [ ] Present diff; wait for approval

### Task 0.4: Update `specs/README.md`

- [ ] Add `WORKSHOP_SPEC.md` to the spec list and keyword index
- [ ] Update Known Discrepancies to reflect closures
- [ ] Present diff; wait for approval

### Task 0.5: Capture coverage baseline

- [ ] After spec edits land, run `just spec-coverage --json` to capture baseline
- [ ] Note: SC-W1..W6 will be 0% covered until Phases 1-3 ship tests
- [ ] Commit baseline

**Phase 0 deliverable:** approved `/specs/WORKSHOP_SPEC.md` + edits to `DISCOVERY_SPEC`, `ROLE_PERMISSIONS_SPEC`, and `specs/README.md`. Verbatim SC text is locked.

---

## Phase 1: Cleanup pass (low-risk, ~1-2 days)

### Task 1.1: Verify dead-service callers

- [ ] **Step 1: Grep**

```bash
rg -n "discovery_dspy|discovery_analysis_service|classification_service|followup_question_service" server/ tests/
```

Expected: results in `services/` self-imports + their own tests only. No active router/service imports.

- [ ] **Step 2: If any non-self caller exists, stop and report**

Re-scope this task to deprecate-and-remove. Do not delete.

### Task 1.2: Delete dead services and demo pages

- [ ] **Step 1: Delete server-side dead services**

```bash
rm server/services/discovery_dspy.py
rm server/services/discovery_analysis_service.py
rm server/services/classification_service.py
rm server/services/followup_question_service.py
rm tests/unit/test_classification_service.py 2>/dev/null || true
rm scripts/repro_discovery_context_overflow.py 2>/dev/null || true
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Delete frontend demo pages**

```bash
rm client/src/pages/AnnotationDemo.tsx \
   client/src/pages/RubricCreationDemo.tsx \
   client/src/pages/TraceViewerDemo.tsx \
   client/src/pages/IRRResultsDemo.tsx \
   client/src/pages/DBSQLExportPage.tsx \
   client/src/pages/UnityVolumePage.tsx
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Remove imports in `WorkshopDemoLanding.tsx`** (lines 16-22)

Delete the demo page imports. The view dispatcher itself goes in Phase 3.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests**

```bash
just test-server
just ui-test-unit
```

Expected: green. Update or delete any test that referenced a deleted page.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git commit -m "chore: delete dead services and unrouted demo pages

Removes ~2K LOC of unrouted demo pages and DSPy/classification
services that were retired per the V2 audit and have no live callers."
```

### Task 1.3: Stop tracking SQLite dev DBs

- [ ] **Step 1: Add to `.gitignore` if missing**

```
*.db
*.db-journal
.e2e-workshop.db*
workshop.db*
mlflow.db*
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Untrack files**

```bash
git rm --cached .e2e-workshop.db* workshop.db* mlflow.db* 2>/dev/null || true
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

### Task 1.4: Fix `update_workshop_participant` no-op

**Spec criteria:** SC-RP2

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing test**

`tests/unit/test_workshop_participant_update.py`:

```python
import pytest
from server.services.database_service import DatabaseService

@pytest.mark.spec("ROLE_PERMISSIONS_SPEC")
@pytest.mark.req("update_workshop_participant persists changes")  # exact text from Phase 0
def test_update_workshop_participant_persists(db_session, sample_workshop, sample_user):
    svc = DatabaseService(db_session)
    p = svc.add_workshop_participant(sample_workshop.id, sample_user.id, role="sme")
    p.role = "facilitator"
    result = svc.update_workshop_participant(p)
    assert result is not None
    assert result.role == "facilitator"
    refetched = svc.get_workshop_participant(sample_workshop.id, sample_user.id)
    assert refetched.role == "facilitator"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run** — `just test-server-spec ROLE_PERMISSIONS_SPEC` — Expected FAIL.

- [ ] **Step 3: Fix** at `server/services/database_service.py:3162-3177`:

```python
def update_workshop_participant(self, participant: WorkshopParticipant) -> WorkshopParticipant:
    db_participant = (
        self.db.query(WorkshopParticipantDB)
        .filter(
            and_(
                WorkshopParticipantDB.workshop_id == participant.workshop_id,
                WorkshopParticipantDB.user_id == participant.user_id,
            )
        )
        .first()
    )
    if db_participant is None:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Participant not found: workshop={participant.workshop_id} user={participant.user_id}"
        )
    db_participant.role = participant.role
    self.db.commit()
    self.db.refresh(db_participant)
    return self._workshop_participant_from_db(db_participant)
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run** — Expected PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git commit -m "fix(participants): update_workshop_participant now persists changes

Closes the Known Discrepancy in specs/README.md:379 — the function
queried the DB but never returned or committed."
```

### Task 1.5: Remove file-based job tracker

User-confirmed: aggressive refactor, no backwards compat. The procrastinate substrate is the V2 replacement (out of scope here); during the gap, async job status simply isn't available — and that's acceptable since the deprecated UI surfaces consuming it (judge tuning, alignment) get rewritten in downstream plans anyway.

- [ ] **Step 1: Find callers (informational)**

```bash
rg -n "AlignmentJob|get_job\(|create_job\(|JOB_DIR" server/ client/
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Remove the tracker**

Delete `AlignmentJob`, `JOB_DIR`, `get_job`, `create_job` from `server/routers/workshops.py:21-130`. Delete any router endpoints that read/write the JSON job files (status, logs).

- [ ] **Step 3: Adapt or stub callers**

For each caller surface that consumed the tracker:
- If the surface gets deleted in Phase 3 (judge tuning UI, etc.), no adaptation needed — caller goes away with it.
- If the surface stays, replace status reads with a stub returning a fixed "in V2 the worker substrate is forthcoming" response, or simpler: remove the status-fetch hook entirely and delete the polling UI.

- [ ] **Step 4: Tests**

```bash
just test-server
just ui-test-unit
```

Expected: tests for the deleted job tracker get removed; remaining tests pass.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git commit -m "chore: remove file-based job tracker

The /tmp/workshop_jobs/ store retires in V2. The procrastinate
worker substrate is its replacement (downstream plan). No backwards
compatibility is preserved — async job status is unavailable in
this transitional state, and consuming UI surfaces are deleted or
rewritten in downstream phases."
```

---

## Phase 2: API + Pydantic reshape (~1-2 days)

Drop phase fields from public schema. Remove phase-advance endpoints. The DB columns stay until Phase 4.

### Task 2.1: Pydantic schema V2

**Spec criteria:** SC-D1, SC-D2

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing test**

`tests/unit/test_workshop_schema_v2.py`:

```python
import pytest
from server.models import Workshop

FORBIDDEN_V2_FIELDS = {
    "current_phase", "completed_phases",
    "discovery_started", "annotation_started",
    "active_discovery_trace_ids", "active_annotation_trace_ids",
    "discovery_randomize_traces", "annotation_randomize_traces",
    "discovery_questions_model_name", "discovery_mode", "discovery_followups_enabled",
}

@pytest.mark.spec("DISCOVERY_SPEC")
@pytest.mark.req("Workshop response excludes phase machinery")  # exact text from Phase 0
def test_workshop_schema_drops_phase_fields():
    schema = Workshop.model_json_schema()
    leaks = FORBIDDEN_V2_FIELDS & set(schema["properties"].keys())
    assert not leaks, f"V2 Workshop schema still exposes: {leaks}"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run (FAIL)**
- [ ] **Step 3: Edit `server/models.py:149-189`** — drop the listed fields from `Workshop` and `WorkshopCreate`. Keep MLflow-related fields (`input_jsonpath`, `output_jsonpath`, `span_attribute_filter`) — workshop-level intake config per architecture doc. Keep `summarization_*` (orthogonal feature).
- [ ] **Step 4: Run (PASS)**
- [ ] **Step 5: Update `database_service.py:137-152`** — `create_workshop` stops setting phase fields explicitly (DB defaults still fire until Phase 4)
- [ ] **Step 6: Regenerate OpenAPI client**

```bash
just generate-client
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Run full unit suite + commit**

```bash
just test-server
just ui-test-unit
git commit -m "feat(workshops): V2 Workshop schema drops phase fields"
```

### Task 2.2: Remove phase-advance endpoints

**Spec criteria:** SC-RP1

- [ ] **Step 1: Grep callers**

```bash
rg -n "advance-to-discovery|complete-phase|resume-phase|startDiscoveryPhase" server/ client/
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Remove handlers** from `server/routers/workshops.py`
- [ ] **Step 3: Remove client callers** in `client/src/components/RoleBasedWorkflow.tsx:48-66` (delete `startDiscoveryPhase`); the button it backs goes away in Phase 3
- [ ] **Step 4: Tests**
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git commit -m "feat(workshops): remove phase-advance endpoints

V2 retires the phase machine; sprint state transitions replace
phase advancement (downstream plan)."
```

### Task 2.3: V2 create endpoint E2E

- [ ] **Step 1: Write E2E**

`client/tests/e2e/v2-workshop-creation.spec.ts`:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.use({ tag: ['@spec:DISCOVERY_SPEC', '@req:Workshop creation accepts thin container fields'] });

test('V2 workshop creation returns clean schema', async ({ request }) => {
  const r = await request.post('/api/workshops/', {
    data: { name: 'V2 W', description: 'x', facilitator_id: 'test-user', mode: 'workshop' },
  });
  expect(r.status()).toBe(201);
  const w = await r.json();
  expect(w.id).toBeTruthy();
  expect(w.current_phase).toBeUndefined();
  expect(w.completed_phases).toBeUndefined();
  expect(w.discovery_started).toBeUndefined();
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run + commit**

```bash
just e2e-spec DISCOVERY_SPEC
```

---

## Phase 3: Frontend reshape (~3-4 days)

Replace creation UI; delete phase machinery from views.

### Task 3.1: WorkshopConfiguratorPage

- [ ] **Step 1: Vitest test**

`client/src/pages/__tests__/WorkshopConfiguratorPage.test.tsx`:

```typescript
// @spec DISCOVERY_SPEC
// @req Workshop configurator submits thin container fields

import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
// ... QueryClientProvider wrapper, MSW mock for POST /workshops
test('submits V2 workshop create with name, description, mode', async () => { /* ... */ });
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run (FAIL)**
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement** — minimal: name (required), description, mode (workshop|eval), submit. No phase UI, no rubric/judge picker (those happen at sprint creation, downstream). On success: navigate to `/workshop/:id`.

```tsx
// client/src/pages/WorkshopConfiguratorPage.tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useWorkshopBootstrap } from '@/hooks/useWorkshopBootstrap';
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from '@/components/ui/card';
import { Input } from '@/components/ui/input';
import { Textarea } from '@/components/ui/textarea';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
import { Label } from '@/components/ui/label';

export function WorkshopConfiguratorPage() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const create = useWorkshopBootstrap();
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [description, setDescription] = useState('');
  const [mode, setMode] = useState<'workshop' | 'eval'>('workshop');

  const onSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const w = await create.mutateAsync({ name, description, mode });
    navigate(`/workshop/${w.id}`);
  };

  return (
    <div className="max-w-2xl mx-auto p-6">
      <Card>
        <CardHeader><CardTitle>New workshop</CardTitle></CardHeader>
        <CardContent>
          <form onSubmit={onSubmit} className="space-y-4">
            <div>
              <Label htmlFor="name">Name</Label>
              <Input id="name" value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} required />
            </div>
            <div>
              <Label htmlFor="description">Description</Label>
              <Textarea id="description" value={description} onChange={(e) => setDescription(e.target.value)} />
            </div>
            {/* mode selector */}
            <Button type="submit" disabled={create.isPending}>Create</Button>
          </form>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run (PASS)**
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

### Task 3.2: Wire route + delete legacy creation pages

- [ ] **Step 1: Update `App.tsx`** — add `<Route path="/workshop/new" element={<WorkshopConfiguratorPage />} />`. Confirm `/workshop/:workshopId` continues to point to `SprintWorkspacePage` (already wired on `feat/social-mode`).
- [ ] **Step 2: Delete** `IntakePage.tsx` (if exists), `WorkshopCreationPage.tsx`
- [ ] **Step 3: Search for refs**

```bash
rg -n "IntakePage|WorkshopCreationPage|/intake" client/
```

Fix or delete refs.

- [ ] **Step 4: Tests + smoke E2E**
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

### Task 3.3: Full delete of `WorkshopDemoLanding`

User-confirmed: full delete, no backwards compatibility. `/workshop/:workshopId` routes directly to `SprintWorkspacePage`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Delete files**

```bash
rm client/src/pages/WorkshopDemoLanding.tsx \
   client/src/components/PhaseControlButton.tsx \
   client/src/components/WorkflowProgress.tsx \
   client/src/components/RoleBasedWorkflow.tsx
```

`RoleBasedWorkflow` was a phase-router; under V2 the role/permission checks happen inline in `SprintWorkspacePage` and the configurator. If a role-check helper is still needed elsewhere, extract it into `client/src/lib/permissions.ts` as a pure function — but only if there are concrete callers; don't pre-create.

- [ ] **Step 2: Update `App.tsx`** so `/workshop/:workshopId` points at `SprintWorkspacePage` directly (verify the existing route on `feat/social-mode` already does this)
- [ ] **Step 3: Update `useWorkshopApi.ts:186-293`** — drop `useWorkshopPhase`, `useWorkshopDiscoveryConfig`, `useCreateWorkshop`. Keep `useWorkshop`, `useWorkshopMeta`. The new `useWorkshopBootstrap` (Task 3.1) replaces `useCreateWorkshop`.
- [ ] **Step 4: Search for stale imports**

```bash
rg -n "WorkshopDemoLanding|RoleBasedWorkflow|PhaseControlButton|WorkflowProgress|useWorkshopPhase|useWorkshopDiscoveryConfig|useCreateWorkshop" client/
```

Expected: results only in this commit's deletions and `SprintWorkspacePage` imports. Fix any stragglers.

- [ ] **Step 5: Lint + unit tests**

```bash
just ui-lint
just ui-test-unit
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git commit -m "feat(workshops): delete phase-machinery view layer

Remove WorkshopDemoLanding, RoleBasedWorkflow, PhaseControlButton,
WorkflowProgress, and the corresponding React Query phase hooks.
SprintWorkspacePage is the V2 workshop landing surface."
```

### Task 3.4: Delete remaining phase pages

```bash
rm client/src/pages/DiscoveryStartPage.tsx \
   client/src/pages/DiscoveryPendingPage.tsx \
   client/src/pages/DiscoveryCompletePage.tsx \
   client/src/pages/AnnotationStartPage.tsx \
   client/src/pages/AnnotationPendingPage.tsx \
   client/src/pages/AnnotationReviewPage.tsx
```

Verify no remaining imports + commit.

---

## Phase 4: Drop legacy DB columns (~1 day)

Code no longer reads/writes phase fields. Drop them.

### Task 4.1: Migration

- [ ] **Step 1: Verify zero callers**

```bash
rg -n "current_phase|completed_phases|discovery_started|annotation_started|active_discovery_trace_ids|active_annotation_trace_ids|discovery_randomize_traces|annotation_randomize_traces|discovery_questions_model_name|discovery_followups_enabled|discovery_mode" server/ client/
```

Expected: results only in the migration file itself.

- [ ] **Step 2: Generate alembic skeleton**

```bash
just alembic-revision -m "drop workshop phase fields"
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Edit migration**

```python

    raise NotImplementedError("V2 phase column drop is one-way")
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run upgrade**

```bash
just alembic-upgrade
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Drop ORM columns** from `server/database.py:139-210`
- [ ] **Step 6: Drop `WorkshopPhase` enum** from `server/models.py:10-26`
- [ ] **Step 7: Run full test suite**

```bash
just test-server
just ui-test-unit
just e2e
```

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git commit -m "feat(workshops): drop legacy phase columns + WorkshopPhase enum

Final V2 workshop creation reshape: WorkshopDB is now a thin
container. Phase machinery is fully retired."
```

## Phase 5 (Final): Lint + Verify Spec Coverage

- [ ] **Step 1: Lint**

```bash
just ui-lint
```

Expected: no errors.

- [ ] **Step 2: Spec coverage**

```bash
just spec-coverage --specs DISCOVERY_SPEC --specs ROLE_PERMISSIONS_SPEC
```

Expected: SC-D1, SC-D2, SC-RP1, SC-RP2 covered. Net coverage stable or up.

- [ ] **Step 3: Untagged tests check**

```bash
just spec-validate
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Full test suite**

```bash
just test-server
just ui-test-unit
just e2e
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Update Implementation Logs** (protected — present diff)

For DISCOVERY_SPEC and ROLE_PERMISSIONS_SPEC, set this plan's log entry status `planned` → `complete`.

## Risks and open questions

1. **Eval mode interaction.** Workshop has `mode ∈ {workshop, eval}`. V2 reshape applies cleanly to `workshop` mode. Verify eval mode flows still pass after each phase.
2. **MemAlign / DSPy deletion timing.** `discovery_dspy.py` deletion depends on grep-confirmation in Task 1.1. MemAlign code paths in `alignment_service.py` stay regardless — they're the engine for the (out-of-scope) refinement worker.
3. **Aggressive refactor stance.** Per user direction, no backwards compatibility. Phase 4 drops columns one-way (no downgrade). Existing dev SQLite DBs are deleted in Task 1.3; no production datasets are in scope.
4. **Spec validation order.** Phase 0 must complete before any test in Phases 1.4, 2.1, 2.3 can be tagged with verbatim `@req` text. Until then, those tests use placeholder requirement strings that will fail `spec-validate`.
5. **Async job status gap.** Removing the file-based job tracker (Task 1.5) leaves no async job status surface in the transitional state. Acceptable per user direction — the consuming UI surfaces are slated for deletion or rewrite in downstream plans, and the procrastinate substrate replaces this in the runtime plan.

## Implementation Log entry (for `WORKSHOP_SPEC.md`)

```markdown
| 2026-04-28 | [V2 Workshop Creation Refactor](../.claude/plans/2026-04-28-v2-workshop-creation-refactor.md) | planned | Drop phase machinery from Workshop; replace IntakePage with thin configurator; sweep creation-adjacent debt (dead services, demo pages, update_workshop_participant no-op, file-based job tracker) |
```

This entry is a **protected operation** (writing to `/specs/`). Present alongside the WORKSHOP_SPEC draft for approval.
