"""Krippendorff's Alpha implementation for inter-rater reliability.

Krippendorff's Alpha is appropriate for:
- Any number of raters (2 or more)
- Ordinal data (like 1-5 Likert scales)
- Binary/nominal data (like 0/1 Pass/Fail)
- Missing data (not all raters rate all items)

Formula: α = 1 - (D_o / D_e)
Where:
- D_o = observed disagreement
- D_e = expected disagreement by chance
- Uses squared distance function which works for both ordinal and binary data
  (for binary 0/1, squared distance equals nominal distance)
