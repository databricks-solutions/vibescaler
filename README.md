# Workshop Annotation Platform

A collaborative platform for annotating and evaluating LLM traces with MLflow integration, discovery phases, and inter-rater reliability analysis.

## 📚 Documentation

For detailed documentation, see the [/doc](doc/) folder:

- **[Facilitator Guide](doc/FACILITATOR_GUIDE.md)** - A comprehensive guide for facilitators to deploy, configure, and run the workshop.
- **[Release Notes](doc/RELEASE_NOTES.md)** - Latest release information and quick start

## 🚀 Quick Start (Recommended)

For production use, we recommend using the **latest stable release**:

> 💡 **Tip:** View all releases at [Releases Page](https://github.com/databricks-solutions/project-0xfffff/releases)

## Installation
Download project-with-build.zip which includes pre-built frontend assets.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Node.js 22.16+**
- **Databricks workspace** with:
  - MLflow experiments
  - Databricks Apps
- **Strongly recommended: just**
   - [Installation](https://just.systems/man/en/packages.html)
   - It's possible to use without this, but the majority of useful scripts use just.



## 🚀 Local Development

### Full Stack With `just`

The easiest local workflow starts both the FastAPI backend and Vite frontend:

```bash
just dev
```

Local development uses `LocalDevIdentityProvider` when Databricks Apps identity headers are absent. By default this materializes a local facilitator with project-management access.

Useful local auth overrides:

```bash
LOCAL_DEV_USER_EMAIL=you@example.com \
LOCAL_DEV_USER_NAME="Your Name" \
LOCAL_DEV_PROVIDER_ROLE=CAN_USE \
just dev
```

Set `LOCAL_DEV_PROVIDER_ROLE=CAN_MANAGE` to test facilitator/project-manager access and `CAN_USE` to test non-manager access.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to client directory:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. **Install Node dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The UI will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

4. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Backend Setup

#### Option 1: Using uv (Recommended ⚡)
1. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   uv pip install -e .
   ```


2. **Run the FastAPI development server in local:**
   ```bash
   uv run uvicorn server.app:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`
   API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

#### Option 2: Using pip (Traditional)

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   # Or for editable install with dev dependencies:
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

3. **Run the FastAPI development server:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn server.app:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`
   API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`


## 🧪 End-to-End (E2E) Tests

E2E tests are run with **Playwright** against a real local stack (FastAPI + Vite) using an **isolated SQLite database**.

```bash
# Run E2E tests headless (default)
just e2e

# Run E2E tests headed (useful for debugging)
just e2e headed

# Run E2E tests in Playwright UI mode
just e2e ui

# Debugging helpers
just e2e-servers   # start API+UI against .e2e-workshop.db
just e2e-test      # run tests (assumes servers are already running)
```

## 🚢 Deploying to Databricks Apps Manually

### 0. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/cli/tutorial) installed and configured:

```bash
databricks --version
databricks current-user me  # Verify authentication
```

### 1. Create a Databricks App

```bash
databricks apps create human-eval-workshop
```

### Databricks Apps Auth Setup

The app does not include its own login screen. In Databricks Apps, users authenticate through Databricks and the backend resolves the current user from forwarded Apps headers.

Required setup:

- Set `DATABRICKS_APP_NAME` or `APP_NAME` to the Databricks App name. The backend uses this when calling Databricks Apps permissions APIs.
- Grant users `CAN_USE` or `CAN_MANAGE` on the Databricks App.
- Users with `CAN_MANAGE` are materialized as facilitators/project managers.
- Users with `CAN_USE` are materialized as non-power users unless they already have a persisted SME/participant app role.
- Add required Apps resources, including Lakebase database (`Can connect and create`) and MLflow experiment (`Can edit`) as appropriate.

For Git-backed Apps, create/configure the app with a Git repository source and deploy from a branch, tag, or commit SHA. Do not use workspace sync for Git-backed deployments.

### 2. Build the Frontend

```bash
cd client && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
```

This creates an optimized production build in `client/build/`

### 3. Sync Files to Workspace

```bash
DATABRICKS_USERNAME=$(databricks current-user me | jq -r .userName)
databricks sync . "/Workspace/Users/$DATABRICKS_USERNAME/human-eval-workshop"
```

Refer to the [Databricks Apps deploy documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/deploy?language=Databricks+CLI#deploy-the-app) for more info.

### 4. Deploy the App

```bash
databricks apps deploy human-eval-workshop \
  --source-code-path /Workspace/Users/$DATABRICKS_USERNAME/human-eval-workshop
```

### 5. Access Your App

Once deployed, the Databricks CLI will provide a URL to access your application.
