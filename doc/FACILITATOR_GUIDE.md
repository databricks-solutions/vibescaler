## Requirements

Before starting the workshop, ensure you have:

- [ ] **At least 2 participants** to provide annotations (required for Judge Alignment)
- [ ] **At least 10 traces** to enable alignment
- [ ] Access to a Databricks workspace with **Databricks Apps** enabled
- [ ] MLflow experiment with traces (if using MLflow ingestion)
- [ ] MLflow experiment [added as an app resource](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/mlflow) with **Can read** permission (grants the app's service principal access — no personal access token needed)
- [ ] Model serving endpoint(s) for AI features (evaluation and alignment LLMs)

---

## Workshop Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, you will have:

- **A calibrated LLM judge** (or multiple judges) tailored to your specific use case
- **Labeled data** generated during the data annotation process
- **A repeatable process** you can scale across all your high-value use cases

---

## Facilitator's Role

As the facilitator, you are **not annotating like an SME**. Your responsibilities are to:

- Configure the workshop
- Control phase transitions
- Facilitate discussion to reach consensus
- Monitor progress and participation
- Turn human judgments into a calibrated LLM judge

---

## Part 1: Deploying the Application

### Step 1: Set Up a Lakebase Autoscaling Database

The workshop uses a Lakebase (PostgreSQL) database for persistent storage. You need to create a project before deploying the app.

1. Open the **apps switcher** (top-right of your Databricks workspace) and select **Lakebase Postgres**
2. Select **Autoscaling** to open the Lakebase Autoscaling UI
3. Click **New project**
4. Enter a project name (e.g., `workshop`) and select your Postgres version
5. Wait for the compute to activate — this creates a `production` branch with a `databricks_postgres` database automatically

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Lakebase Autoscaling documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/oltp/projects/get-started).

> **Why Lakebase?** Databricks Apps run in ephemeral containers. A Lakebase database ensures your workshop data (traces, annotations, rubrics) persists across app restarts and redeployments.

### Step 2: Create the App

1. Click the **Compute** icon in the sidebar, then go to the **Apps** tab
2. Click **Create app**
3. Select **Create a custom app**
4. Enter your app name (e.g., `judge-builder-workshop`)
5. Click **Create app**

### Step 3: Configure App Resources

In the **Configure** step, click **"+ Add resource"** in the **App resources** section for each of the following:

#### A. Database (Lakebase)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Resource type** | Database |
| **Project** | Select the Lakebase project from Step 1 |
| **Branch** | `production` |
| **Database** | `databricks_postgres` |
| **Permission** | Can connect and create |
| **Resource key** | `postgres` (default) |

When deployed, Databricks automatically injects these environment variables: `PGHOST`, `PGDATABASE`, `PGUSER`, `PGPORT`, `PGAPPNAME`, and `PGSSLMODE`.

#### Local Development With a Lakebase Branch

For local development, use Lakebase branching instead of sharing the production branch or inventing a separate local schema:

1. In Lakebase, create a branch such as `local` from the same project used by the app.
2. Open the Connect modal for that branch and copy the PostgreSQL `DATABASE_URL`.
3. In the repo, run `just configure-lakebase-local` and paste the branch URL.
4. Start the stack with `just dev postgres`.

The helper writes `.env.lakebase.local` (ignored by git), parses the branch URL into the `PG*` variables expected by the backend, and uses your Databricks CLI user as `PGUSER`. Keep `PGAPPNAME` at its default (`human-eval-workshop`) unless you intentionally want a different schema; the Lakebase branch is the isolation boundary.

#### B. Serving Endpoints

Add a resource for each model serving endpoint used by the workshop's AI features (evaluation LLM, alignment LLM, etc.):

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Resource type** | Model serving endpoint |
| **Endpoint** | Select your serving endpoint |
| **Permission** | Can query |
| **Resource key** | e.g., `llm_endpoint` |

> **Tip:** If you use separate endpoints for evaluation and alignment, add each one as its own resource.

#### C. MLflow Experiment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Resource type** | MLflow experiment |
| **Experiment** | Select the experiment containing your traces |
| **Permission** | Can edit |
| **Resource key** | e.g., `mlflow_experiment` |

### Step 4: Deploy the App

You can deploy directly from the GitHub repository — no need to download or import source code.

#### Option A: Deploy from Git (Recommended)

1. On the app details page, configure the Git repository:
   - Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/databricks-solutions/project-0xfffff`
   - Select **GitHub** as the Git provider
   - Click **Save**
2. Click **Deploy**, then select **From Git**
3. Enter the **Git reference**: `main` (or a specific release tag like `v1.10.0`)
4. Select the **Reference type** (branch or tag)
5. Click **Deploy**

> **Note:** Databricks Apps automatically runs `npm install` and `npm run build` during deployment. No pre-built files are needed.

#### Option B: Deploy from Workspace

If you prefer to deploy from a workspace copy (e.g., for an air-gapped environment):

1. Download the source code zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/databricks-solutions/project-0xfffff/releases)
2. In Databricks, go to **Workspace** → click the **three dots** → **Import**
3. Drag and drop the zip file and click **Import**
4. On the app details page, click **Deploy**
5. Select the workspace folder containing the app files, then click **Select** → **Deploy**

### Step 5: Access the App

1. Wait for the deployment to complete (this may take a few minutes as dependencies are installed and the frontend is built)
2. Once the app shows **Running** status, click the link next to it
3. Congratulations! The app is deployed successfully!

## Part 2: Managing Participants

Navigate to: **Facilitator Dashboard** → **Add New User / Workshop Users**

### Adding Users

1. Enter the user's **Email**
2. Enter the user's **Full Name**
3. Select the **Role**:
   - **SME** → Provides discovery feedback AND annotates during Annotation Phase
   - **Participant** → Provides discovery feedback only
4. Click **Add User**

![Add User Interface](facilitator_guide_images/20-facilitator-dashboard.png)

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] All users show **Active** status
- [ ] Correct role distribution (at least 2 SMEs recommended)
- [ ] User breakdown shows expected counts

---

## Part 3: Intake Phase

The Intake Phase is where you get data into the workshop.

### Option A: MLflow Trace Intake

#### Step 1: Configure MLflow Connection

Fill in the MLflow configuration:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Databricks Host** | Your workspace URL (e.g., `https://adb-xxx.azuredatabricks.net`) |
| **Experiment ID** | The MLflow experiment containing your traces |
| **Max Traces** | Number of traces to import (recommend **10** to start) |
| **Filter String** | Optional filter (e.g., `attributes.status = 'OK'`) |

> **Note:** No personal access token is needed. The app authenticates using its service principal, which receives permissions automatically when you [add the MLflow experiment as an app resource](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/mlflow).

#### How to Find the Experiment ID

1. Go to **Serving** in Databricks
2. Select the model serving endpoint containing your traces
3. Click the **model version** (e.g., Version 1)
4. This takes you to the registered model in Unity Catalog
5. Click the **Source Run** under "About this version"
6. Copy the **Experiment ID** from the URL

![MLflow Configuration](facilitator_guide_images/07-mlflow-configuration.png)

#### Step 2: Ingest Traces

1. Click **Ingest Traces from MLflow**
2. Verify the Intake Status shows:
   - ✅ Configured
   - ✅ Ingested
   - Correct trace count

![Intake Status](facilitator_guide_images/08-intake-status.png)

### Option B: Upload CSV

If MLflow access isn't available:

1. Prepare a CSV with `request_preview` and `response_preview` columns
2. Click **Select CSV File**
3. Choose import destination:
   - **Import directly into Discovery** - Add traces for immediate use
   - **Log to MLflow as traces** - Create MLflow traces for later import
4. Click **Upload to Discovery**

### Reset Option

If the data is incorrect, use **Delete All & Reset Workshop** to start over.

---

## Part 4: Discovery Phase

In this phase, participants explore traces and provide qualitative feedback to inform the rubric.

### Starting Discovery

1. Go to the **Discovery Phase**
2. Choose your configuration:
   - **Standard Discovery (10 traces)** - Randomly selects traces; participants may get different subsets
   - **Custom** - Choose a specific number of traces; all participants see the same traces
3. Optional: Enable **Randomize trace order** (OFF by default)
4. Click **Start Discovery Phase**
5. Give participants time to provide feedback (e.g., 10 minutes)

![Discovery Configuration](facilitator_guide_images/10-discovery-configuration.png)

### Monitoring Progress

Track the following metrics:

- **% Completion** - Overall progress
- **Active Users** - Who is currently participating
- **Trace Coverage** - Are all traces being reviewed?

![Discovery Monitoring](facilitator_guide_images/26-discovery-monitoring.png)

### Quick Actions

| Action | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Add More Traces** | Discussion is shallow, need more examples |
| **Pause Discovery** | Need group discussion |
| **Reset & Reconfigure** | Traces are poor quality |

### What Participants Are Doing

Participants will:
- Review traces (input/output pairs)
- Write qualitative feedback on strengths and weaknesses
- Identify edge cases

---

## Part 5: Rubric Creation

Convert discovery insights into structured evaluation criteria.

### Facilitator Workflow

1. **Review participant responses** to identify patterns
   - Look for repeated strengths, weaknesses, and disagreements

2. **Facilitate discussion** using concrete examples
   - Use specific traces and comments to surface differing interpretations

3. **Capture emerging quality signals**
   - Record key insights in the scratch pad

4. **Translate insights into rubric criteria**
   - Create clear, consistent evaluation questions

### Creating Evaluation Criteria

For each criterion, configure:

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **Question Title** | Clear, descriptive name (e.g., "User Intent", "Response Accuracy") |
| **Question Description** | Precise explanation of what to evaluate |
| **Evaluation Type** | Likert (1-5 scale), Binary (Pass/Fail), or Free-form |

![Rubric Creation](facilitator_guide_images/30-evaluation-criteria.png)

### Example Criteria

- **User Intent**: Does the response align with user intent?
- **Response Accuracy**: Is the information factually correct?
- **Completeness**: Does the response fully address the question?
- **Business Relevance**: Is the response appropriate for the use case?

---

## Part 6: Annotation Phase

SMEs apply the rubric to label traces. As facilitator, you observe but do not label.

### Configuration

1. Go to the **Annotation Phase**
2. Choose trace selection:
   - **Start with a subset** - Recommended for focused sessions
   - **Use all available traces** - For comprehensive annotation
3. Optional: Enable **Randomize trace order**
4. Click **Start Annotation**
5. Give SMEs time to annotate (e.g., 5 minutes)

![Annotation Configuration](facilitator_guide_images/31-annotation-config-start.png)

### Monitoring

Track:
- Traces annotated (e.g., 3/10)
- Participation per SME
- Rating distribution

> ⚠️ **Important:** Do not influence ratings mid-stream unless there's confusion about the rubric.

### What SMEs Are Doing

SMEs will:
- Rate each trace using the rubric criteria
- Optionally add reasoning for their ratings

![SME Annotation View](facilitator_guide_images/33-sme-annotation-view.png)

### Quick Actions

- **Add More Traces** - Include additional traces for annotation
- **Judge Name** - Set the name for MLflow feedback entries
- **Pause Annotation** - Temporarily halt the annotation phase

---

## Part 7: Results Review

Diagnose disagreement between annotators using Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR) metrics.

### Understanding Krippendorff's Alpha

| Alpha Value | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **< 0** | Systematic disagreement |
| **~0** | Random agreement (no reliability) |
| **0.6+** | Acceptable alignment |
| **0.8+** | Good alignment |

### Review Process

1. **Review IRR per criterion** - Identify which criteria have low agreement
2. **Read Identified Issues** - See specific traces with disagreement
3. **Lead discussion** with SMEs:
   - "Why did we disagree here?"
   - "What interpretation differed?"

![IRR Results](facilitator_guide_images/34-irr-results-summary.png)

### Addressing Low Agreement

| Issue | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Ambiguous rubric | Clarify wording |
| Missing context | Add examples/counterexamples |
| Too complex | Simplify or split criteria |
| Interpretation differences | Re-annotate a subset |

---

## Part 8: Judge Tuning

Transform human annotations into a calibrated LLM judge.

### Prerequisites

- ✅ At least 10 SME-annotated traces
- ✅ At least 2 annotators

### Configuration

1. Select **Evaluation LLM** (e.g., GPT-5.1)
2. Select **Alignment LLM** (for SIMBA optimizer)
3. Verify **Judge Name** (set in Annotation Phase)

### Running Evaluation and Alignment

1. **Run `evaluate()`** - Establishes baseline judge performance
2. **Run `align()`** - Optimizes judge prompt against human labels

![Judge Tuning](facilitator_guide_images/36-judge-alignment.png)

### Tuning Multiple Judges

Use the **"Select Judge to Tune"** dropdown to tune judges for each evaluation criterion one by one.

### Execution Logs

Monitor the logs for:
- Baseline mini-batch scores
- Processing bucket information
- Optimization progress

---

## Part 9: Data Management

Export workshop data for further processing or analysis.

### Options

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Upload to Unity Volume** | Store in Unity Catalog for team access |
| **Download Database** | Download complete workshop database locally |

### Unity Volume Upload

1. Enter the **Volume Path** (e.g., `catalog.schema.volume_name`)
2. The filename is auto-generated
3. Click **Upload to Unity Volume**

### Local Download

1. Click **Download Workshop Database**
2. The `.db` file includes all traces, annotations, rubric data, and configuration

## FAQ

### Which LLM judge should I use for evaluation?

Use a **strong reasoning model** for evaluation. For alignment, GPT-5.1 has shown better results (as of 12/19/2025), though this hasn't been quantified compared to Sonnet.

### What is "baseline mini-batch" in the execution logs?

The baseline mini-batch score represents the judge score compared to human-annotated scores. Each bucket represents a mini-batch of data.

### Why does my prompt look the same after running alignment?

If there isn't much disagreement between the LLM judge and human annotations, the alignment process has fewer differences to learn from. Alignment creates a new prompt to bridge the gap between LLM and human judgments—if the gap is small, changes will be minimal.

### What's the difference between Standard Discovery and Custom?

- **Standard Discovery**: Randomly ingests traces; each participant may get different subsets
- **Custom**: All participants see the same traces, ensuring consistent coverage

### How do I close out a workshop?

The ideal outcome is a skeletal version that produces a notebook containing:
- `evaluate()` results
- `align()` results
- Scorer configuration
- Prompt optimization output
