# Changelog

## v1.3.0 (January 13, 2026)

### New Features
- **Database Migrations with Alembic**: Added Alembic for proper database schema migrations (contributed by Forrest Murray)
  - `0001_baseline.py` - Initial schema baseline
  - `0002_legacy_schema_fixes.py` - Legacy schema compatibility
  - `0003_judge_schema_updates.py` - Judge table schema updates
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage** (contributed by Forrest Murray)
  - Server unit tests for routers (`databricks`, `dbsql_export`, `users`, `workshops`)
  - Server unit tests for services (`alignment`, `cohens_kappa`, `irr`, `krippendorff_alpha`, `token_storage`)
  - Client-side unit tests
  - E2E tests with Playwright (`rubric-creation`, `workshop-flow`)
- **Justfile Commands**: New database management commands (contributed by Forrest Murray)
  - `just db-upgrade` - Run Alembic migrations
  - `just db-stamp` - Stamp current migration
  - `just db-revision` - Create new migration
  - `just db-bootstrap` - Bootstrap database
  - `just e2e` - Run end-to-end tests
- **DB Bootstrap on FastAPI Lifecycle**: Database bootstrap now runs automatically on app startup
- **MLflow GenAI Skills**: Added Claude skills documentation for MLflow GenAI evaluation, tracing, and troubleshooting (`.cursor/skills/`)

### Bug Fixes
- **Binary Judge Fix**: Fixed critical issue where MLflow was returning Likert-style values (e.g., 3.0) instead of binary 0/1 for binary judges
  - Prepended strong binary format instructions to judge prompts (models pay more attention to prompt start)
  - Changed `feedback_value_type` from `bool` to `float` for more reliable 0/1 parsing
  - Added fallback threshold conversion: Likert values >=3 convert to PASS (1), &lt;3 to FAIL (0)
- **Database Indentation Fix**: Fixed IndentationError in `server/database.py` that prevented server startup

### Improvements
- Binary judge prompts now include explicit examples showing valid 0/1 output format
- Better error messages with fallback conversion logging for debugging
- Log messages now accurately reflect the `feedback_value_type` being used

### Contributors
- Forrest Murray - Database migrations, Alembic setup, test coverage
- Wenwen Xie - Binary judge fixes, MLflow GenAI skills

## v1.2.0 (January 5, 2026)

### New Features
- **Binary Scale Support**: Full support for Pass/Fail evaluation alongside Likert (1-5) scale
- **Free-form Text Responses**: Qualitative feedback in annotations

### Improvements
- IRR recalculation uses `toast.promise()` for better UX (no duplicate toasts)

- Default annotation traces increased from 10 to 15
- Mode badge now correctly shows MLflow vs Simple Model Serving

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed IRR recalculation showing duplicate notifications
